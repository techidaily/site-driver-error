## **2: Update drivers**

 If uninstalling the IDE ATA/ ATAPI controller drivers doesn’t solve the problem for you, it’s likely that you’re using the wrong driver altogether.

 There are two ways you can get the right drivers for your disc /DVD drive: manually or automatically.

**Manual driver update**  – You can update your disc drive driver manually by going to the manufacturer’s website for your computer, and searching for the most recent correct driver for it. Be sure to choose only driver that is compatible with your variant of Windows 10.

**Automatic driver update** –  If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can do it automatically with [**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .  Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your exact disc drive, and your variant of Windows 10, and it will download and install it correctly :

 1)[**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.
