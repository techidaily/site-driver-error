## Rectify Windows 7 Dell Pad Connection Issues

 If the touchpad of your Dell laptop does not work correctly due to faulty drivers, updating drivers can fix the problem. Driver status can be checked in [Device Manager](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . There are 3 ways you can use to update the driver in Windows 7\. Note it is very important to download and install the right driver, as faulty driver may cause problems.

[Way 1: Update the driver through Device Manager](https://aidotcom.pxf.io/nkz4kv)
[Way 2: Download and install the driver from Dell](https://bluettide.pxf.io/ekmjb2)
[Way 3(Recommended): Update the driver using Driver Easy](#Way3)

 **Way 1: Update the driver through Device Manager**

Follow these steps:

 1\. Open [Device Manager](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

If Windows fails to update the driver, proceed to other 2 ways.

 **Way 2: Download and install the driver from Dell**

 Before you get started, ensure that you know the laptop model and the specific system that you are using (Windows 7 32-bit or Windows 7 64-bit).

 1\. Open your favourite browser and type “PC model+driver download”. Let’s take Dell Vostro 3460 for example.
