3) Search the latest driver for your sound card model and Windows operation system version.

4) Download and install the driver on your computer.

 Though it’s direct and straight forward to download the driver from manufacturer’s website, it requires computer technology, patience and indeed costs too much time. Luckily, you can do this automatically with Driver Easy.
