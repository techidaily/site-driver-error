## How can I make my external Seagate hard drive show up again?

 You may not need to try them all, just work your way down until you find the one that works for you.

**[1: Try A Different USB Port](https://turtlebeacheu.sjv.io/1r0r59)**
**[2: Reinstall Seagate Programs](https://bluettieu.pxf.io/nlgoka)**
**[3: Partition the Hard Drive](https://versadesk.pxf.io/xyboxx)**
**[4: Assign Driver Letter to Seagate GoFlex](https://dreoaffiliateprogram.pxf.io/k0ezjl)**
**[5: Disable Fast Startup](https://coinrule.sjv.io/rqzonv)**

## **Method 1: Try A Different USB Port**

 Unplug your Seagate hard drive from its current port, and plug it into a working USB port, for instance, the one for your mouse.

 If you have another well-functioning computer, try to plug your Seagate hard drive into that computer and see if the problem persists.

 If your Seagate external hard drive can be recognized via another USB port, the problem is solved, all you need to do is reconnect your hard drive to another port.

 If your Seagate external hard drive won’t work in either situation, your hard drive could be at fault. You might need to consult the technical support of Seagate to see if your data in the hard drive can be retrieved somehow.
