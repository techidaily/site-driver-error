First, make sure that you login to computer as Administrator. If you are not logged in with Administrator, follow steps below to switch it to Administrator.  
  
1\. Go to**Control Panel**and View by**Category**. Click**User Accounts**.(In your case, this may be “User Accounts and Family Safety”.)

After that, reinstall the driver again.  
  
 **Turn off any antivirus or anti-spyware program**
  
If you are using an Administrator account and the problem persists, turn off any antivirus and anti-spyware program temporarily. This will work if the update is blocked by these program.
  
**Give permission to USBSTOR registry key**
  
If the problem could not be resolved, the USBSTOR registry key most probably has denied access to SYSTEM account. Follow these steps and give permission to USBSTOR registry key.
  
1\. Press**Win+R**(Windows key and R key) at the same time. A Run dialog will open.  
2\. Type**regedit**in the run box and click**OK**button.

 3\. Go to **HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\USBSTOR.** Right-click on it and select**Permissions…** from the context menu.

 4\. Select**SYSTEM** from the Group or user names. In Permissions for SYSTEM section, make sure the Full Control Allow checkbox is checked and uncheck any Deny checkbox. Click Apply button to apply the changes.

 Also check your user account and see if it has full control of the system and any deny checkbox is unchecked.

 After that, update the USB driver again and it should work this time.
