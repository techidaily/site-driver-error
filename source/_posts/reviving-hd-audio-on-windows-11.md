## Method 2: Download & install the correct Intel High Definition Audio Driver manually

 Without asking for a driver updater for help, you can also choose to directly download the driver for your audio card and audio controller manually from its manufacturer’s website. Or if you’re using a brand laptop, you can download the drivers from your laptop’s official website.

 Here we take**Intel display audio driver** as an example to show you how to download and install the driver manually.  
````

 Intel offers audio drivers together with graphics card drivers. So you need to download the graphics driver to get the audio driver.

1. Go to **[Intel Downloads Center](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/)**  .
2. Type **Intel HD Graphics + Model Number** in the **Search** box. Then press **Enter** .  (Here we take   **Intel HD Graphics 5500**  as an example)  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/1-17.png) ```` ``
3. Choose**Windows 10 64-bit**  or**Windows 10 32-bit (according to your PC)** from the drop-down menu.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/2-16.png)
4. Choose the**first** item of the page as it is the latest version.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/3-10.png)
5. Click the**.exe** file to download and install by prompts easily.

6. Restart your computer to make changes take effect.

## Method 3: Uninstall your driver

 If updating your drivers won’t help, uninstalling the latest driver might work for you. Windows will install the last working audio driver back for you once the current driver is removed.

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo + R keys** simultaneously to open the Run box. Then type**devmgmt.msc** and hit Enter to open Device Manager.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/run-devmgmt.msc_.jpg)
2. Scroll down and find**System devices** . Click it and look for your audio program. It could be**Intel(R) Smart Sound Technology Audio Controller** or**High Definition Audio Controller** .
