## 2: Update Device Drivers

But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

## 3: Update Software and Operating System

 Sometimes missing software updates and service packs could cause the Code 10 error in device manager. If you suspect this is the problem, it is suggested that you update and install the latest updates for Windows.

## 4: Manually fix corrupted registry entries

To fix the problem, you might want to fix the registry entries by yourself. **Note** : To use this method, you must be logged on to Windows as an **administrator** . **IMPORTANT** : Follow the steps in this section carefully.

 1) On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** and **R** at the same time to invoke a **Run** command. Then type **regedit** in the search box and press **Enter** .
