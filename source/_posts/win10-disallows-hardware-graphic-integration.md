### Fix 2: Update your display driver

 This problem is**mostly caused by an out-of-date graphics card driver** , otherwise known as a **display driver** or **video driver** . You can fix it easily by updating your display driver.

 There’re **two**  ways you can update your display driver: manually and automatically.

**Manually —**  To update the display driver, you can choose to download the latest one from your display adapter manufacturer’s website, such as [Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/) , [AMD](http://support.amd.com/en-us/download) , [NVIDIA](http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx) **…**

**Automatically —** However, manual driver update is really time-consuming. If you are not tech savvy or, if you don’t have time and patience to do it manually, we highly recommend you update your display driver automatically using **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .  It’s a simple process. Here’s what you need to do:

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install to run Driver Easy.

 2) Click **Scan Now** . It will quickly detect all driver problems of your computer. This includes your display driver.

You can update the drivers one by one using the **Update**  button. But if you upgrade to the **[PRO Version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  , you can update all your drivers with one click — **Update All** .
