 2) See if you can see your USB flash drive listed here as a**Removable** disk. If you can see it, move on to the next step.

 If you cannot see it, please try:

* **Change a different port** . Please try plug your device into a different USB port on your computer to eliminate the possibility that the first port is not working.
* **Avoid USB hubs** . If you are connecting your USB drive via a USB hub, please try connect it directly into the USB ports, since the the USB hub might not supply enough power.
* **Try a different computer** . Please try connect your USB flash drive with another computer to see if the other computer detects it. If you cannot see it listed on the Disk Management window on the other computer, it is very likely that this USB drive is dead.
* **Power on the drive** . On some USB drive, there are power switches or separate power cables on them. If your USB flash drive fits the description, switch the power on your USB flash drive.

 **Step Two: Fix the problem**

 Here are different resolutions based on different symptoms shown on your screen. Please choose accordingly the right description for your situation.

 **If Windows asks you to format the partition when you insert in your USB drive**

 1) You might be seeing the notification below, **don’t format** **just** **yet** , since it just erase everything on your USB flash drive.

 It is possible that the drive was formatted with a file system that Windows doesn’t normally support, such as Mac or Linux system.

 If you don’t need the files on the disk, you can go ahead and choose**Format disk** option to move on.

 If you want to read a drive like this, you can connect it to the Mac or Linux PC that it was made on and copy the files off of it to another drive. Or you can choose to use a third-party program that you trust to help you “read” the content on it.

**If your PC cannot see the USB drive, but other PCs can**

 If this very drive is not showing on your computer, but can be seen on other computer, there might be something wrong with the USB drive driver on your PC.

 1) Press**Windows key** and**X** at the same time, then choose**Device Manager** .
