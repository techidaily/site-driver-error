### **What is Windows Hello?**

**Windows Hello** allows you to login into your system by recognizing your fingerprint or your face or your iris (like Surface) rather than using a pin code or a password, provided that you have a webcam and a finger scanner that work.  
  
 With Windows 10 Anniversary Update, this feature has extended to apps and websites, which include banking apps and other sensitive apps.

### **How do I fix it?**

 Here are 3 solutions for you to try. You may not have to try them all; just work your way down until you find the one works for you.
  
[**1. Update Your PC**](https://silver-cuisine.pxf.io/nlgolx) [**2\. Enable Biometric from Administration**](#2)
[**3\. Update Your Fingerprint Device Driver**](#3)

## **Step 1: Update Your PC**

 First of all, make sure that you’ve installed any possible update that is available for Windows 10\. See if you have needed patches installed:

 1) On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**I** at the same time. Click **Update & security** .
