### Fix 4: Disable or uninstall antivirus

 It’s also possible that your antivirus is blocking BattlEye. You can**close** any antivirus on your computer and**run** your game**as administrator** and see if this solves your problem.

 What does **Run as administrator** do?  
 If you run an application as administrator, you’re notifying your computer system that the application you’re going to run is safe and should be allowed with administrative privileges.

 To run your game as administrator, you can right-click on the executable (.exe) file of or the desktop shortcut to your game, and then select**Run as administrator** .
