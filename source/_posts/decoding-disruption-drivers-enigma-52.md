### Solution 1: Install the correct driver for your device

 The Code 52 error is mainly caused by the **incorrectly signed driver file** installed on your computer. You can replace it with the correct driver to fix the error.

 You can get the correct driver for your device either manually or automatically.

 Manual driver update  
  
 Your device manufacturer keeps updating drivers. To get them, you need to go to the manufacturer’s website, find the drivers corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 64-bit), and download the driver manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct drivers for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

 **Automatic driver update**
  
 If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update your device driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with Driver Easy. Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your exact device, and your Windows version and it will download and install them correctly:

 1)[](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now**  button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

 3) Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with **full support and** a 30-day money-back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)

 Note: You can do it **for free** if you like, but it’s partly manual.

 Once you install the correct driver for your device, check if the error disappears. If your device works without any problem, so great! If you still see the error, don’t give up hope, you still have something else to try…

### Solution 2: Delete both the UpperFilters and LowerFilters Registry values

 The **UpperFilters** and **LowerFilters Registry values** may also cause Code 52\. You can delete them to try to solve the problem.

Here’s how to delete the values:

 1) On your keyboard, hold down the **Windows logo key** , then press **R** to bring up the Run box.

 2) Type **regedit** and press **Enter** .

 6) In the Class section, Click **{36FC9E60-C465-11CF-8056-444553540000}** , then on its edit pane on the right side, right-click **UpperFilters** to select **Delete** \> **OK** .

 7) On the same edit pane, right-click **LowerFilters** , then **Delete** \> **OK** .

 Close the Registry Editor window and restart your computer. Then check if the error disappears.

### Solution 3: Enable the ‘Disable driver signature enforcement’ feature

 If unfortunately, the above methods both fail to help, you can try to Enable the ‘**Disable driver signature enforcement’** feature to solve the error if your computer is running **Windows 8 and onwards** .

Here’s how you can do it:

 1) On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** to bring up the Start menu.

 2) On your keyboard, **hold down** the **Shift** key. Then click the **power icon** on the Start menu, and proceed to click **Restart** . Your Windows system would then restart into the Boot menu.

 3) Click **Troubleshoot** .
