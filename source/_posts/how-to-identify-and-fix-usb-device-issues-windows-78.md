## **Method 3: Remove External Devices**

If there are too many USB devices connected to your PC, some of them might not respond or work properly. To fix it, you can try clean restart your PC: Remove or disconnect all unnecessary discs and devices from your computer. Make sure that the computer is off, and then remove any discs and USB devices and the memory cards from the card reader slot.

Then reconnect the USB devices one by one. If you are using**desktop**: 1) Turn off the computer completely and disconnect the power cord from the back of the computer. 2) Press the power button on the computer for 5 seconds. 3) Reconnect the power cord and turn on the power.

## **Method 4: Create INF Files**

1) Go to**C:\\Windows\\inf**folder. Make sure you can see these files listed: (there could be other files)**usb.inf,** **usb2.inf,** **usbport.inf,** **usbprint.inf,** **usbstor.inf,** **usbvideo.inf** ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/usb-inf-file-folder.jpg) 3) If some of the above files are missing, you need to create them. If you have another computer with all the USB ports well functioned, look for the files in that computer, copy and paste them here. 4) If you don’t have another computer, here is the alternative for you. Download the mentioned files from this webpage <http://www.infdump.com/>. You can find the files by searching with the name of the files. Download the files**usb.inf,** **usb2.inf,** **usbport.inf,** **usbprint.inf,** **usbstor.inf,** **usbvideo.inf**, one by one. You can save them directly to the **C:\\Windows\\inf** folder when you are downloading or you can copy them to the**C:\\Windows\\inf** folder all together after you have downloaded all of them. 5) After the files are replaced or created, you need to unplug all of your USB devices and then plug them back in again. If necessary, you can also do a reboot. **Related post:** **[What to do if USB not recognized in Windows 10?](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
