When you plug your iPhone like iPhone 7 to your PC, if you meet MTP USB Device Failed to install issue, your iPhone can’t be recognized by PC. From the error message, you can tell that the MTP USB Device driver was not successfully installed. The problem can be caused by several issues. Try solutions in this post and the problem should resolve. Apply to Windows 10, 7, 8, 8.1, XP&Vista.

**Solution 1: Uninstall the MTP USB Device**
  
 Follow these steps:  
  
 1\. Open [Device Manager](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

 3\. Right click on the device and select**Uninstall** from the pop-up menu.

 If Windows fails to provide the new drivers, you can download the driver manually. Downloading drivers manually can’t be easy and can take you a lot of time. So instead of downloading drivers manually, you can use Driver Easy to download drivers automatically, which can scan your computer quickly to detect problem drivers and give you a list of new drivers. Click [here](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) to download Driver Easy now.  
  
 Driver Easy has Free version and Professional version. Both versions can be used to download drivers automatically. But with Professional version, you can even update all drivers with 1 click. No time is wasted at all. More importantly, you will enjoy Free technical support guarantee and money-back guarantee. You can ask for further assistance regarding your iPhone MTP USB Device driver issue. And you can ask for a full refund for any reason.  
  
**Solution 3: Editing the Relative Registry**
  
 Note modifying registry entries might cause serious system problems, especially if it is done incorrectly. Before you get started, it is recommended that you back up the registry. See [How to Back Up and Restore Registry](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .  
  
1\. Press **Win+R** (Windows logo key and R key) at the same time. A Run dialog will appear.
 2\. Type**regedit**  in the run box and click **OK**  button. Then Registry Editor will open.

 3\. Navigate to **HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE-> SYSTEM-> Current Control Set -> Control -> Class** .

 5\. In the right pane, find**UpperFilters** . Right-click on it and click**Delete** .  
 6\. Unplug your iPhone and reboot the computer.  
 7\. After restarting, plug in your iPhone again.  
  
 If none of above solutions work for you, the cause might be USB port or the cable. Plug your iPhone to different USB port and see if it works. And use another cable to have a try. This may work like a charm.
