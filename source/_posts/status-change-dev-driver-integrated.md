## Method 2: Make sure you have the correct compatible version driver for your Windows

 To enable your device to work properly in Windows, your device driver should be compatible with your system. For example, if you use a 64 bit Windows 10 operating system, your device driver should be compatible with this version. In other words, if your device driver is for 32 bit Windows 10 or Windows 7, Code 37 may occur.

 You can go with these following steps to make sure you have the correct version of your device driver:

 1) On your keyboard, press the   **Windows logo key ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/win-key.png)**  and **R**  at the same time to invoke the Run box.

 2) Type **devmgmt.msc**  and click **OK** .
