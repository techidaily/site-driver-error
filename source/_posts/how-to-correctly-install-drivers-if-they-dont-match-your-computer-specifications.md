## Why this error occurs?

 You must wonder why this error would occur as you downloaded the driver from Intel official website. Read on then you’ll know why.

 To update Intel drivers, you can download the new driver not only from the Intel but also from the computer manufacturer. Intel supplies the generic versions of drivers for the generic purpose. And the computer manufacturer changes and customizes the Intel generic drivers in order to get the hardware work at its best performance.

 Usually, you’re recommended to download the driver from the computer manufacturer first. If you install the driver from Intel, your computer may block the installation, then you’ll get errors like this.
