## How to Download ACPI Drivers

ACPImeans “Advanced Configuration and Power Interface”, which is responsible for controlling power states of the PC and attached peripherals. If you have problem with this device, you may already see that it is displayed as Unknown Device in Device Manager with a yellow mark. Here you will learn how to download ACPI drivers.  
  
**Download Drivers Using Hardware ID**
  
Usually, we can download drivers from manufacturer’s website by using the device name and the system version. But for ACPI, it is impossible to get the exact device name. This makes it harder to download drivers in this way. In this case, you can use its hardware id to search and download drivers.  
  
If you are not sure how to get the hardware id, follow these steps.  
  
1) Open Device Manager.

2) Right-click on the**Unknown device** and click**Properties** .

 3) Go to **Details** tab and click the drop down menu of**Property** .

 Select**Hardware Ids** from the drop down menu and the value field will populate with a list of values.

 Right-click on the top-most value and choose**Copy** from the menu.

 Copy and paste the Hardware ID value into the search engine you like. You can also use your OS version and the key word “driver” to search the driver.
  
**Download and Update Drivers using Driver Easy**
