## **Solution 2: Uninstall problem drivers to fix IRQL\_NOT\_LESS\_OR\_EQUAL**

 The problem can be caused by faulty drivers. To fix the problem, go to**Device Manager** and find the faulty drivers, then uninstall the drivers. If a driver is having problems, you’ll see a yellow mark next to its device (see the screenshot shown below).

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/img_5ad8287f6daa6.jpg)

Following steps are for your reference on how to uninstall a driver:

 1) Press  Win+R  (**Windows logo** key and**R** key) at the same time to invoke the run box.  
  
 2) Type **devmgmt.msc**  and click **OK** . Then Device Manager window will open.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/img_5a13fe52a4642.jpg)

 5) Restart your PC and check to see if the blue screen is gone  .  

## Solution 3 **: Perform a System Restore to fix IRQL\_NOT\_LESS\_OR\_EQUAL**

 The last solution that you can try is to do a system restore. If your System Protection is turned on, Windows will create a restore point before you install the driver. Then you can follow these steps to restore the driver to an earlier version to fix this issue.

 System Restore allows your system to go back to an earlier state. So some content of your system, like system settings, some programs, the registry, will be affected. But your personal files and data won’t be changed.

 1) Press**Win+R** (Windows logo key and R key) at the same time to invoke a run box.

 2) Type **rstrui.exe** and click**OK** . The System Restore Window will open.
