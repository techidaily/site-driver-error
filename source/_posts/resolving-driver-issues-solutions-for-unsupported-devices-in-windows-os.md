 If you find**No drivers are installed for this device** when checking one of your devices on**Device Manager** , you‚Äôre not alone. But don‚Äôt worry ‚Äì you can fix it easily just by updating the driver for it! üôÇ

## Choose the way you prefer

**[Option 1 ‚Äì Automatically (Recommended)](#O1)**  ‚Äì This is the quickest and easiest option. It‚Äôs all done with just a couple of mouse clicks ‚Äì easy even if you‚Äôre a computer newbie.

**OR**

**[Option 2 ‚ÄìManually](https://cowinaudio.pxf.io/pyx40e)**  ‚Äì You‚Äôll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right the driver online, download it and install it step by step.

### **Option 1 ‚Äì Download and install the device driver  automatically (Recommended)**

 If you don‚Äôt have the time, patience or computer skills to update the device  driver in question manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don‚Äôt need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don‚Äôt need to be troubled by the wrong driver you would be downloading, and you don‚Äôt need to worry about making a mistake when installing. Driver Easy handles it all.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either [**the FREE**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) or **[the Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks:

3. C  lick **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of **_ALL_**  the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**   ‚Äì you‚Äôll be prompted to upgrade when you click **Update All** ).  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/img_5bd1a6e5bf6d4.jpg) You can also click **Update**   to do it for free if you like, but it‚Äôs partly manual.
4. **Restart**   your computer, check Device Manager to see if the**no drivers are installed for this device** problem has been solved.

### **Option 2 ‚Äì Download and install the device driver  manually**

 To manually download & install the driver in question, firstly you‚Äôll have to go to   **the hardware‚Äôs official website** , search your model of you device and then download & install it all on your own. And unless you know the exact model type to search and the variant of your Windows Operating System, it can present certain levels of difficulty.

**Warning** : Downloading the wrong driver or installing it incorrectly can compromise our PC‚Äôs stability and even cause the whole system to crash. So please proceed at your own peril.

So here we go:

1. Go to the manufacturer‚Äôs official website.
2. Check out the **Support**   section for **driver downloads** , then type in **the model of the hardware piece**   you want a driver update with and search.
3. Among the driver releases, make sure to **ONLY**   choose drivers that are both most up-to-date and compatible with **your variant of Windows Operating System** .
4. Run the downloaded file to finish the install.
5. **Restart**   your computer and don‚Äôt forget to c heck**Device Manager** and see if the **No drivers installed for this device** problem has been fixed.
