## Fix 1: Update your driver

 According to Microsoft, the recommended resolution for the error code 48 in Device Manager is to contact the hardware vendor for a new driver. In other words, you should be able to fix this issue by updating the driver of your problematic device to the latest version.

 There are mainly 2 methods you can update drivers on your Windows computer.

**[Option 1: Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it, and install it step by step.

Or

**[Option 2: Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/asus-usb-bt500-bluetooth-5-0-usb-adapter-driver/#h-option-2-update-the-asus-usb-bt500-bluetooth-driver-automatically-recommended)**  – This might be the quickest and easiest way to get all the latest drivers for your computer. All you need is a few clicks.

### Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually

 The manufacturer of your computer keeps releasing new drivers on its official site. To get them, you need to go to the manufacturer’s site, find the drivers corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 32-bit), and download the driver manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct drivers for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Option 2 – Automatically update drivers

3. Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.  
![Update drivers with Driver Easy](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Update-drivers-with-Driver-Easy.jpg)  
 (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** . If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and [manually install them, the normal Windows way](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .)
4. Restart your PC and check if this issue persists.

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with _full technical support_ . If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://bellelily.pxf.io/m5azgm) .**

 Normally, the error code 48 in Device Manager will be fixed after you update the drivers to the latest version.

 If not, you may need to try the fixes below one by one and then reinstall the latest drivers.

## Fix 2: Disable Hyper-V

 Some Windows users reported that Windows 10 works fine with the device when [the Hyper-V feature](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/about/) is disabled. The error code 48 appears only when the Hyper-V feature is enabled.

 If you don’t need the Hyper-V feature, just try disabling it to see if the error code 48 disappears. Here is how to do it:

1. On your keyboard, press**the Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to open the**Run** dialog. Type**appwiz.cpl** and press**Enter** to open the**Programs and Features** window in the**Control Panel** .  
![appwiz.cpl](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/appwiz.cpl_.jpg)
2. Click**Turn Windows features on or off** .  
![Turn Windows features on or off](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Turn-Windows-features-on-or-off.jpg)
3. In the Window that pops up,**uncheck the box** next to**Hyper-V** and click**OK** to disable the Hyper-V feature.  
![Disable the Hyper-V feature](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Disable-the-Hyper-V-feature.jpg)
4. Restart Windows 10 to see if the issue persists.

 If this fix didn’t work, try the next fix to turn off Memory Integrity.

## Fix 3: Turn off Memory Integrity in Core isolation

 Memory Integrity is a security feature of Core isolation in Windows 10 settings. It is designed to prevent attacks from inserting malicious code into high-security processes and device drivers.

 This feature works fine with most devices. However, for Intel HD 4000 graphics card users, or for those who tried to update drivers but still failed to fix this issue, try turning off Memory Integrity before reinstalling the latest drivers.

To turn off Memory Integrity, simply follow the steps below:

1. On your keyboard, press**the Windows logo key** and type**core isolation** . Click**Open** to open the Core isolation window in Windows 10 settings.  
![Open Core isolation](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Open-Core-isolation.jpg)
2. **Turn off** the toggle under**Memory integrity** .  
![Turn off Memory integrity](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Turn-off-Memory-integrity.jpg)
3. Restart Windows 10 and reinstall the latest driver of the problematic device.

See if this fix works. If not, try the next fix, below.

![Windows Memory Diagnostic](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Windows-Memory-Diagnostic.jpg)
3. Select**Restart now and check for problems (recommended)** to run the test immediately. Before restarting, you need to save your work and close any open programs. It may take some time to complete the test.  
![Check your computer for memory problems](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Check-your-computer-for-memory-problems.jpg)

 See if there is something wrong with the memory on your PC. If everything is OK, open Device Manager to check if the “The software for this device has been blocked from starting because it is known to have problems with Windows (Code 48)” error persists.

 Normally, after trying all the fixes above and reinstalling the latest driver of the problematic device, this issue would be fixed.
