 You can update drivers through Windows Update. But sometimes Windows Update may cause update errors. “Device driver software was not successfully installed” is one of the common Windows Update errors. If you receive this message while updating**Microsoft Xbox One Controller driver** , don’t worry, as you can fix the problem with one of the methods in this post.

 There are two methods to fix the problem. Try them one by one until you fix the problem.

1. [**Uninstall the Driver and Reconnect the Controller**](https://copa.sjv.io/6eoowq)
2. [**Update the Driver Using Driver Easy (Recommended)**](#method2)

## **Method 1: Uninstall the Driver and Reconnect the Controller**

 2) Type**devmgmt.msc** and press**Enter** on your keyboard. This is to open Device Manager.
