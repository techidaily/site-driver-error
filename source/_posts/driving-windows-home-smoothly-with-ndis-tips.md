 If you ever encountered an NDIS driver issue, don’t worry – you’re not alone. Usually you can solve this type of problems by updating the NDIS drivers, which is not hard to perform.

## How to update NDIS drivers

There are mainly two ways you can update your NDIS drivers:

**[Option 1 – Update drivers via Device Manager](https://electronicx.pxf.io/xkwqkk)**  – This is the most common method to update your driver, but sometimes Windows may fail to provide you with the latest (and even necessary) device drivers.

OR

**[Option 2 – Update drivers via Driver Easy (Recommended)](#option2)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.
