 If you keep getting the error message saying “Intel Management Engine Interface has a driver problem”, that means your current Intel Management Engine driver is incompatible with your system. To fix it, you should update your Intel ME driver. There are two ways you can do this:

**[Option 1 – Manually](https://aligracehair.sjv.io/y209r3)** – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right the driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

**[Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)](#b)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

### **Option 1 – Update the driver manually**

 You can use the Windows built-in utility Device Manager to reinstall your driver manually. Follow the instructions below:

**1)** On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo** key and**R** at the same time to open the Run dialog.

**6)** Find the drivers corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 32 bit).

**7)** Download the driver manually.
