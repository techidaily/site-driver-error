### Solution 2: Roll your Prolific USB to Serial driver back to an older version

 You may note that up-to-date drivers always keep your devices working in the best condition. But sometimes the latest driver doesn’t work with old hardware.

So you can try to**downgrade your Prolific USB to Serial driver** .

Here’s how you can do it:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo + R keys** simultaneously to open the Run dialog box.
2. Type**devmgmt.msc** and hit Enter.
