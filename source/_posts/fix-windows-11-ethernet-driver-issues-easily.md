[**Step Three: Download and update the driver**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)   
  
**Note** : It is always suggested that you try update your device driver via Device Manager first. Windows will usually provide you with the latest version of driver it could find. But this is not always work, especially when you are already having problem with your current driver. So it is suggested that you update your drivers in some other ways.   
  
  
 **Step One: Identify the driver you need**   
  
 1) To update your driver, the first thing you need to do is to identify the device driver you have.   
  
 To accurately identify the model of the device driver you have, please press**Windows key** and**X** at the same time, then choose**Device Manager** .

 Yours could be with the name**Realtek PCIe GBE Family Controller** , or**Broadcom NetLink (TM) Gigabit Ethernet** or some other names,   
  
 Once you have identify the name for your driver, move on to the next step.   
  
  
**NOTE:**   
  
 1) Alternatively, you can also go to the support of the manufacturer of your computer, such as ASUS, ACER, HP, Dell, Lenovo, and then search for the available updates for your device drivers. It requires that you know exactly the model of your computer, which might be easier for those with laptops.   
  
 2) Also, to increase the preciseness of the driver located, you can also check the hardware IDs for your device so as to make sure that you are not downloading the faulty driver for your device.   
  
 To check the hardware IDs, double click the device driver you have, and then navigate to the**Details** tab. Then choose Hardware Ids from the drop down box. And you will be able to see the detailed information for your device.

 You can copy and paste the hardware IDs in the search engine to look for the driver in this way if you are a more advanced computer user.   
  
  
 **Step Two: Locate the driver manually**   
  
 1) Now that we have the model of the Ethernet adapter driver, we can go to appropriate websites to search for the driver that we need.   
  
 Take the device that we have for an example, we are having **Intel 82574L Gigabit Network Connection**  driver, so we are going to support website of**Intel** .   
  
 Go to the **Drivers & Software**  section on **Intel Support** first. Type in the name of our adapter in the middle box. Then hit the search icon.

 2) You should go to the support website of the manufacturer for your Ethernet driver. If the manufacturer is Realtek, go to Realtek support; if the manufacturer is Broadcom, just go to Broadcom support accordingly.   
  
  
 **Step Three: Download and update the driver** 
  
 1) Now that we have located the driver in the support website of the network adapter manufacturer, which is**Intel** in this case, we just need to choose**Drivers** from the drop down menu on the left.

 2) Choose from the results the driver that fits your situation. We can see that the latest version of the driver seems to be designed for Windows 7 OS, but we can give it a try to install it on our Windows 10 OS.
