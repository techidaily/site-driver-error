 **Method 2:[Update your display driver to the latest version](https://pish-posh-baby.sjv.io/g1jg15)**
 **Method 3:[Manage your NVIDIA Control Panel settings](https://coinrule.sjv.io/rqzonv)**

## Method 1: Roll back your display driver to an earlier version

 If there is problem with your current display driver, you can roll it back to an earlier version to see if it works.

Follow these to rollback your display driver:

 1) On your keyboard, press the   **Windows logo key ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/win-key-6.png) ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/win-key-5.png)**  and **R**  (at the same time) to invoke the Run box.

 2) Type **devmgmt.msc**  and click **OK** .

**Important:**  If you see the Rolling Back Driver button is grayed out, it means there’s no available earlier version of the display driver on your computer. You can go to your graphics card manufacturer’s website to download a previous one and install it on your computer. Or you can skip to try the other following methods.

 5) Tick on **My apps don’t work with this driver** , then click **Yes** .

Your display driver should be rolled back then.

 6) When complete, restart your computer and open your program again to see if successfully.

## Method 2: Update your display driver to the latest version

 If rolling back your display driver doesn’t help to fix your problem, don’t be upset. Try to update your driver, and this is always recommended to do not only when you have problems. Up-to-date drivers can make your computer run fast and keep stable.

You can update your display driver either manually or automatically.

**Manually** – Go to your graphics card official manufacturer’s website, then  search for the most recent correct driver for your graphics card. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your Windows.

**Automatically**  – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your display driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your graphics card, and your Windows, and it will download and install them correctly:

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**   and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now**   button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

(This requires the **Pro** version which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)
