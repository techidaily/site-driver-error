### Fix 2 – Clean install of the driver

#### End NVIDIA processes

1. Right-click any empty space on your taskbar and click**Task Manager** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/clean-install-4-1.jpg)

 After you finish installing, reboot the machine for the changes to take effect and test if your NVIDIA driver is back on track. If not, move on to the third fix.

### Fix 3 – Temporarily disable antivirus

 The program you’re running in the background, whether it’s a GPU monitoring utility or antivirus software, might conflict with your NVIDIA driver installer and prevent it from launching. To see if that’s the case, you can**temporarily disable those background programs** and install the NVIDIA driver again. If the installation goes smoothly, then congrats! If the issue persists, don’t frustrate. There is one more fix to try.

### Fix 4 – Repair system files

 If none of the methods helped, the problem is likely related to system issues. Missing or damaged system files can lead to different types of installation issues on your computer. To fix it and keep your PC at tip-top condition, you could perform a thorough scan and repair of your system.

**[Fortect](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  is a safe and professional repair solution with various functions. It can not only replace corrupted Windows files and components, but also detect security threats like viruses or malware while improving your device’s stability.

2. Open Fortect and click**Yes** to run a free scan of your PC.
