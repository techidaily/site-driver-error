## What is PCI device driver?

**PCI** stands for Peripheral Component Interconnect. The PCI device you see in Device Manager indicates the piece of hardware that plugs into your computer’s motherboard, such as**PCI Simple Communications Controllers** and**PCI data Acquisition and Signal Processing Controller** as shown in the above screenshot. These are the hardware devices that keep your PC running smoothly.

 If these devices have yellow exclamation marks next to them, your computer functionality suffers. So you should get them fixed asap.
