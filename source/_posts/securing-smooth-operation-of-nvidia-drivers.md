### Fix 7: Check for hardware issues

 If the fixes above didn’t work, then the problem probably lies with the hardware. It can be an overheating, dust problem of your graphics card, or the components not being connected properly etc. So you should remove your graphics card from the computer case to do proper troubleshooting. Please make sure that you do this only when you know what you’re doing, since any mishandling with the hardware could possibly render your graphics card or your computer useless.
