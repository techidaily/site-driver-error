### Fix 4: Disable antivirus programs temporarily

 The Nvidia drivers crash problem may also happen because of conflicts between your antivirus programs and Nvidia. You can test if this is the case by temporarily disable the antivirus programs to see if the crash reoccurs.

If Nvidia still keeps crashing, please move on to Fix 5, below.

### Fix 5:**Update DirectX**

 DirectX is a suite of components in Windows that allows heavy multimedia apps such as games to interact with your video and audio cards.

So it’s important that you run the latest version of DirectX to see if it resolves the Nvidia drivers keep crashing problem.

 If you’re not sure which version of DirectX your computer is running, or how to update DirectX, please refer to this **[quick guide](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

### Fix 7: Check for hardware issues

Please make sure that you do this only when you know what you’re doing, since any mishandling with the hardware could possibly render your graphics card or your computer useless.
