### Fix 1: Update your USB Composite Device driver

 The most likely cause for your USB Composite Device error is a device driver problem.

Fortunately, this is one of the easiest problems to fix.

 There are two ways to update your USB Composite Device driver:**manually** and**automatically** .

**Update your USB Composite Device driver manually** — You can update your driver manually by going to the hardware manufacturer’s website, and searching for the latest driver for your USB Composite Device. If you take this approach, be sure to choose the driver that’s compatible with the exact model number of your hardware, and your version of Windows.

**Update your USB Composite Device driver automatically** — If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to be troubled by the wrong driver you would be downloading, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. Driver Easy handles it all.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click **Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click**Update** next to any flagged devices to automatically download the correct version of their drivers, then you can install them manually.

**key**  
 and  
**R**  
  key simultaneously to open the Run box.

4. Right-click on the first USB device and select**Uninstall device**  to remove it.  

**Important:** Make sure you’ve saved any open files on your computer before you click**Uninstall device** , as you might need to force shutdown and restart later.

5. Repeat step 4) with every other USB device that is listed under the**Universal Serial Bus controllers** entry.  

**Note:** Some USB devices have to do with your wired mouse, keyboard etc, which means uninstalling those devices will make them not working, don’t worry, just temporarily. As long as Windows restarts, it will automatically install the drivers again.
6. Once you’ve uninstalled them all,**restart** your computer.  

 If your mouse or keyboard is not working for now, you may need to force shutdown: you can press the power button of your computer for a few seconds until it begins to shutdown. Then, press the power button again to start your computer.
7. When you’ve logged on to your Windows desktop, plug your USB composite device into your computer and test.
