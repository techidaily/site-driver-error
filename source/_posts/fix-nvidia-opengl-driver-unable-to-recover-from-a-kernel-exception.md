 The code 3 error indicates a kernel mode exception inside the display driver. Most display drivers including NVIDIA graphics card driver run in kernel mode. The exception occurs because the NVIDIA graphics card cannot execute the data arriving at the kernel mode.

 The cause could be:**outdated or faulty video drivers** , **overlocking CPU (Central Processing Unite) or GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)** . To fix the problem, you can try to update the NVIDIA graphics card driver or set the CPU or GPU back to the standard clocks:

## **Update the NVIDIA graphics card driver**

 The first and easiest method you can try is update the NVIDIA graphics card driver. You can go to NVIDIA’s official website to download the latest driver. If you’ve installed the latest version, try to install a different version maybe an older version.
