 Fix a Service Installation Section in this INF is Invalid issue. Follow the steps in this article.

 After you connect your Android device to your computer, you find you can’t use the device and don’t see it on your computer. Then you go to Device Manager to check for the driver status. In Device Manager, you see a MTP USB device with a yellow exclamation mark under the category “Portable Devices” (In some cases, Unknown Devices under Other Devices). When you try to update the driver via Windows Update, you get this error message: _**A service installation section in this INF is invalid**_  . You have no idea how to fix this problem. That’s why you come to this post, right? Don’t worry. You can fix the problem easily with one of the solutions here.

 The problem occurs probably due to missing or corrupted USB driver files. Windows has built-in USB drivers, which allow you to connect USB devices to your PC without installing the drivers manually. But if the drivers are missing or having problems, after connecting the USB devices to your computer, you can’t use it directly. In this case, you need to install the drivers manually. There are different reasons causing driver files missing or corrupted. You’re likely to get this error especially if you’re using the streamlined system or upgraded the system to Windows 10.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version, it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money-back guarantee):

## Solution 3: Install the missing driver files manually

 If the built-in USB driver fiels**mdmcpq.inf** and usbser.sys are missing or corrupted, the problem could occur. So to fix the problem, you can try to install these two driver files. You can replace them with the same files on another computer. Follow the steps below：

 This solution requires you to have another computer with no such problem.

 1) On the computer with no such problem (The computer can run any Windows version), locate file **mdmcpq.inf** in**C:\\Windows\\INF.** Copy and save this file to an external drive.
