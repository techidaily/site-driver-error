If Windows fails to update the driver, proceed to other 2 ways.

 **Way 2: Download and install the driver from Dell**

 Before you get started, ensure that you know the laptop model and the specific system that you are using (Windows 7 32-bit or Windows 7 64-bit).

 1\. Open your favourite browser and type “PC model+driver download”. Let’s take Dell Vostro 3460 for example.
