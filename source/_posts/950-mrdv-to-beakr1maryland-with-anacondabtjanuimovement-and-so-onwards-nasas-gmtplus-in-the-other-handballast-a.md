### **What is Windows Hello?**

**Windows Hello** allows you to login into your system by recognizing your fingerprint or your face or your iris (like Surface) rather than using a pin code or a password, provided that you have a webcam and a finger scanner that work.  
  
 With Windows 10 Anniversary Update, this feature has extended to apps and websites, which include banking apps and other sensitive apps.

### **How do I fix it?**

 Here are 3 solutions for you to try. You may not have to try them all; just work your way down until you find the one works for you.
  
[**1. Update Your PC**](https://silver-cuisine.pxf.io/nlgolx) [**2\. Enable Biometric from Administration**](#2)
[**3\. Update Your Fingerprint Device Driver**](#3)

## **Step 1: Update Your PC**

 First of all, make sure that you’ve installed any possible update that is available for Windows 10\. See if you have needed patches installed:

 1) On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**I** at the same time. Click **Update & security** .

When you finish, move on to the second step.
  
## **Step 2: Enable Biometric from Administration**

 If you don’t have the administrator permission, you’re not likely to use Windows Hello on your PC. To fix it:

 1) On your keyboard, press **the Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time, then type **gpedit.msc** and press **Enter** .

 4) You can choose to reboot your computer for Windows to help you locate the driver that it could find for your device.  
  
 Or, as an alternative, you can choose to update the driver by yourself.

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can do it automatically with [**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

 1)[**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

 3) Click the**Update** button next to the flagged fingerprint device to automatically download and install the correct version of this driver (you can do this with the FREE version).
