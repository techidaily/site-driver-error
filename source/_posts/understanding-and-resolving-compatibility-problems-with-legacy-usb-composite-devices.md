### Fix 2: Reinstall your USB controller drivers

 You can also try uninstalling and reinstalling the USB drivers via Device Manager. This action will allow Windows to automatically scan for hardware changes and reinstall the needed drivers. Here’s what you need to do:

1. On your keyboard, press the   **Windows logo ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/img_5b62735e40ac6.png)**  
**key**  
 and  
**R**  
  key simultaneously to open the Run box.
2. Type **devmgmt.msc** and press**Enter** .

3. In Device Manger, scroll down to find**Universal Serial Bus controllers** and expand the entry.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/img_5b61714f05a95.jpg)
4. Right-click on the first USB device and select**Uninstall device**  to remove it.  

**Important:** Make sure you’ve saved any open files on your computer before you click**Uninstall device** , as you might need to force shutdown and restart later.

5. Repeat step 4) with every other USB device that is listed under the**Universal Serial Bus controllers** entry.  

**Note:** Some USB devices have to do with your wired mouse, keyboard etc, which means uninstalling those devices will make them not working, don’t worry, just temporarily. As long as Windows restarts, it will automatically install the drivers again.
6. Once you’ve uninstalled them all,**restart** your computer.  

 If your mouse or keyboard is not working for now, you may need to force shutdown: you can press the power button of your computer for a few seconds until it begins to shutdown. Then, press the power button again to start your computer.
7. When you’ve logged on to your Windows desktop, plug your USB composite device into your computer and test.
