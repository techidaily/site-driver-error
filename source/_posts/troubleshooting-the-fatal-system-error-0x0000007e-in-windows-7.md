 If you’re on Windows and you suddenly run into the blue screen of death error with the error code 0x0000007E, you’re not alone. Many Windows 7 users are reporting this problem as well. But no worries, it’s possible to fix, however dreadful the blue screen may look like.

 Here are 4 methods for you to try. You may not have to try them all; just work your way down until you find the one works for you.

 **Method 1:[Remove unsafe or incompatible drivers](https://dymocks-australia.pxf.io/lxv4xa)**

 **Method 3:[Update Video Drivers](https://25home.pxf.io/vnbxnv)**

**IMPORTANT** :  You’ll need to be logged into Windows on the problem computer to try any of these solutions. If you can’t log into Windows, reboot your computer into [safe mode](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) , then try these solutions.

## 1\. Remove unsafe or incompatible drivers

 This blue screen of death error is likely to be caused by unsafe or incompatible drivers.

 Microsoft once worked out a hotfix for Windows 7 or Windows Server 2008 R2 users. You can download it and have a try. But it’s not always helpful since the exact causes are different.

 Instead, you should verify if all the drivers installed in your PC is safe and secure. Uninstall drivers that you are not sure about the security or stability. Then restart your computer.

 Recently updated new drivers might be incompatible with your operating system.If you have installed such drivers, you should uninstall them as well.

See if this problem is resolved after the restart.
