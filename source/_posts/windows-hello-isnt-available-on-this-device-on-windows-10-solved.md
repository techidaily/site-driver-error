 If you’re having “**Windows Hello isn’t available on this device.** ” in your **Settings** windows, you’re not alone. Many Windows 10 users are reporting this problem as well. No worries, it’s possible to fix. Here is the 3-step fixes for you to fix your problem.

### **What is Windows Hello?**

**Windows Hello** allows you to login into your system by recognizing your fingerprint or your face or your iris (like Surface) rather than using a pin code or a password, provided that you have a webcam and a finger scanner that work.  
  
 With Windows 10 Anniversary Update, this feature has extended to apps and websites, which include banking apps and other sensitive apps.

### **How do I fix it?**

 Here are 3 solutions for you to try. You may not have to try them all; just work your way down until you find the one works for you.
  
[**1. Update Your PC**](https://silver-cuisine.pxf.io/nlgolx) [**2\. Enable Biometric from Administration**](#2)
[**3\. Update Your Fingerprint Device Driver**](#3)

## **Step 1: Update Your PC**

 First of all, make sure that you’ve installed any possible update that is available for Windows 10\. See if you have needed patches installed:

 1) On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**I** at the same time. Click **Update & security** .

When you finish, move on to the second step.
  
## **Step 2: Enable Biometric from Administration**

 If you don’t have the administrator permission, you’re not likely to use Windows Hello on your PC. To fix it:

 1) On your keyboard, press **the Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time, then type **gpedit.msc** and press **Enter** .
