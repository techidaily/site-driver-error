### 1\. Make sure your Bluetooth is turned on

 Before getting started, it’s recommended that you check your Bluetooth status to make sure it’s already on by going to the Action Center (in the lower-right corner of your desktop):

1) The Bluetooth will be highlighted if it’s turned on.

 2) On your keyboard, press the**Windows** logo key +**R** key and enter**ms-settings:bluetooth** to open your Bluetooth settings.

 3) Add Bluetooth devices again. If your devices are listed here, you can remove them and add them back again. If your Bluetooth option is also missing from settings or grayed out, it means there’s some problem with your Bluetooth driver, and you should go to the next fix instead.

![bluetooth settings](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/image-15-1200x938.png)

 Restart your PC and check if this fixes your**Bluetooth missing from Device Manager** problem. If it doesn’t show in the Device Manager, you can try the next fix below.

### 2\. Run the Bluetooth troubleshooter

 If the Bluetooth problem persists, you can first try the Windows diagnostic tool to find the exact problem:

 1) On your keyboard, press the**Windows** logo key +**R** key at the same time and enter the command line:**`msdt.exe -id DeviceDiagnostic`** to open the device troubleshooter.

 But if there’s no problem detected, you can head on to the next fix.

### 3\. Reinstall the Bluetooth driver manually

 The Windows automatic repair tool can find and apply the fix for your device, but sometimes it fails to detect any problems, which is also very common. If that’s your case, you can **[reinstall the Bluetooth driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  manually by visiting the manufacturer’s official website to get the exact driver and install it on your PC (since you can’t do it via the Device Manager).

 But if you’re not that tech-savvy or don’t have the time to do that, you can reinstall your Bluetooth driver in one click with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and   **you get full technical support and a 30-day money back guarantee**):

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

![update with driver easy](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/image-20-1200x914.png)

 2) If you just want to update your Bluetooth driver for free, simply click the**_Update_** button next to it (it’s partly manual).

 Or click**_Update All_** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/image-21-1200x914.png)

**Note:** You can uninstall a driver by clicking the down arrow key next to a device, and selecting**Uninstall driver** .

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with full technical support.  
 If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://bellelily.pxf.io/m5azgm) .**

 3) After updating your Bluetooth driver,**restart your computer** for it to take full effect. Make sure you have checked**Show hidden devices** in Device Manager.

![show hidden devices](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/image-26-1200x890.png)

### 4\. Restart the Bluetooth service

 If reinstalling the Bluetooth driver still fails to fix your Bluetooth missing from Device Manager problem, you can restart the Bluetooth-related system services to check if this does the trick.

 1) On your keyboard, press the**Windows** key +**R** key at the same time, and enter**services.msc** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/image-22.png)

 2) Once the Services window opens, locate Restart Bluetooth Support Service. Right-click the**Bluetooth Support Service** and select**Restart** . If it’s not working, you can right-click it and select**Start** .
