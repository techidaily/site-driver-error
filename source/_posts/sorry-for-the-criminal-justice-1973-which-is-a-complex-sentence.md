Further down in this post, you’ll know what the driver is and how to deal with related issues. Now read on and find out possible solutions for yourself.

## What is WPD FileSystem Volume Driver?

 WPD FileSystem Volume Driver is not the driver for a particular device. Instead, WPD stands for “Windows Portable Device” which covers a wide range of devices such as mobile phones, digital cameras, etc. Since the driver often appears with a yellow exclamation mark, it is in fact an error sign notifying you of certain problems with your device. When you notice this entry listed below the “Portable Devices” node, there’s huge likelihood that the portable device you’ve just connected to the PC is not working properly, or not recognized by the computer. Whatever problem you’re faced with, please rest assured that you’re not alone. Usually it’s not very hard to resolve.

### Fix 1: Reinstall your drivers

 In most cases, issues related to the WPD FileSystem Volume Driver are down to driver errors. One of the most typical is the Code 10 error that shows up when Device Manager cannot start your hardware device due to outdated or corrupt drivers. There may be other triggers for this error, but they’re also associated with your drivers at large.

 The first thing you should do is to reinstall your WPD FileSystem Volume Driver, whatever device it is used for. Here’s how:

 1) On your keyboard, press the**Windows Logo** **key** ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/img_5ae0331bc08e4-1.png) and**R** at the same time to invoke the Run dialog box. Then, type**devmgmt.msc** and click**OK** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/2019-06-17_14-24-52-2.png)

 2) There pops up the Device Manager. Double-click on the**Portable Devices** node to expand its drop-down list. Below you’ll see this entry –**WPD FileSystem Volume Driver** .

 The WPD FileSystem Volume Driver can also be found in other device nodes depending on your own situation.

 Click**Uninstall** if prompted for confirmation.
