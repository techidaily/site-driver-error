## **Method 2: Update the Base System Device driver manually**

 Usually, you can go to the device manufacturer’s website or the PC manufacturer’s website to download the latest driver. But for Base System Device, it is impossible to know what the specific device is. The good news is you can get its device name and its vendor name to determine what it is.

 Follow steps below to get the device name and its vendor name.

 1) In Device Manager, right-click the device and click**Properties** .

 5) Go to [https://pci-ids.ucw.cz/.](https://pci-ids.ucw.cz/) Then you can use the VEN code and the DEV code to figure out what the Base System Device stands for.

 6) After you figure out what the device is, you can go to the PC manufacturer’s website or the device manufacturer’s website to download the driver. It’s recommended to go to the PC manufacturer’s website first, as they may customize the driver.
