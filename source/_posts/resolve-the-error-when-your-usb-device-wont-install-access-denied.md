After that, reinstall the driver again.  
  
 **Turn off any antivirus or anti-spyware program**
  
If you are using an Administrator account and the problem persists, turn off any antivirus and anti-spyware program temporarily. This will work if the update is blocked by these program.
  
**Give permission to USBSTOR registry key**
  
If the problem could not be resolved, the USBSTOR registry key most probably has denied access to SYSTEM account. Follow these steps and give permission to USBSTOR registry key.
  
1\. Press**Win+R**(Windows key and R key) at the same time. A Run dialog will open.  
2\. Type**regedit**in the run box and click**OK**button.
