### Method 2: Configure the BIOS settings

 The keys used to enter BIOS depend on the motherboard you’re using. Configuring BIOS can be risky, as incorrect settings can cause serious system problems. If you have advanced computer skills, you may be able do this on your own. If not, it’s recommended you contact the motherboard vendor for assistance. Their support may help you to enter the BIOS and enable the Intel Turbo Boost Max Technology.

### Method 3: Uninstall the Intel Turbo Boost Max Technology software

 One of the methods to resolve the problem is to uninstall the Intel Turbo Boost Max Technology software. Intel Turbo Boost Max Technology can help boost CPU performance.
