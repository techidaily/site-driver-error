## **Method 1: Try A Different USB Port**

 Unplug your Seagate hard drive from its current port, and plug it into a working USB port, for instance, the one for your mouse.

 If you have another well-functioning computer, try to plug your Seagate hard drive into that computer and see if the problem persists.

 If your Seagate external hard drive can be recognized via another USB port, the problem is solved, all you need to do is reconnect your hard drive to another port.

 If your Seagate external hard drive won’t work in either situation, your hard drive could be at fault. You might need to consult the technical support of Seagate to see if your data in the hard drive can be retrieved somehow.

## **Method 2: Reinstall Seagate Programs**

 If your Seagate app is not installed properly, problems like not being recognized by computers will happen. To fix it:

 1) On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and I at the same time to invoke**Settings** .

 2) Click **System** .

 4) Go to the [**official website of Seagate**](http://www.seagate.com/gb/en/support/downloads/item/goflex-home-iso-software-master/) and download the software, create the install CD according to the instructions and then reinstall the software again on your computer.
