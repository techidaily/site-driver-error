 If your**PCI Data Acquisition and Signal Processing Controller** is listed under **Other devices** with a giant yellow exclamation mark next to it, which indicates that something is off with your network driver, you’re not alone. Many Windows users are reporting this problem as well. This problem usually means that you’re having network connection problems.

 But no worries, it’s possible to fix. Read on and follow the easy-doing steps.

 Whenever you see the yellow exclamation marks in your Device Manager, the first thing you need to do is to update available device drivers for your PC.

## Option 1 – Update device drivers manually

 1) Go to the support website and then locate the appropriate page of your computer, then look for**drivers** or**software** section.

 2) There, you will see the list of available device drivers waiting for you to download. Pay extra attention to**network card driver** and**chipset driver** .

 3) Choose your operating system and then choose to**download** all the available drivers for your PC.

 4) When the download finishes,**install** the drivers included one by one by yourself. You may need to restart your computer a couple of times so as to make the changes take effect.

 In some cases, the chipset driver is an**.inf** file, which poses a problem to a lot of users. We are using**Intel Chipset Device Software** as an example to show you**how to install** such a driver.

**NOTE** : The chipset driver you have might have different names, which is totally okay. PC manufacturers will customize the Intel chipset so as to meet the exact specifications on their computers. If you don’t want to loose the customized features, choose to download chipset from your PC manufacturer.

 1)**Download** the appropriate chipset driver for your PC and save it to your desktop, or somewhere you will never ignore.
