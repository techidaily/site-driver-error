### Fix 2: Turn off test mode

 Drivers should be test-signed with a digital signature during development and test. And unsigned drivers are allowed to load only in test load. If there’re any unsigned drivers on your computer, and with test mode on, they may cause driver load errors like   **Failed To initialize battleye service:Driver Load Error (1450)** . You can try turning off test mode to stop unsigned drivers from working and to solve your problem:

1. Type**cmd** in the search box, then right-click **cmd** and select**Run as administrator** .

### Fix 3: Update your device drivers

 A corrupted or outdated device driver may also cause the **Failed To initialize battleye service:Driver Load Error (1450)** error. You should update your device drivers to better troubleshoot your problem.

 There are two ways to update your drivers:**manually** and**automatically** .

**Update your drivers manually** — You can update your driver manually by going to the hardware manufacturer’s website, and searching for the latest driver. But if you take this approach, be sure to choose the driver that’s compatible with the exact model number of your hardware, and your version of Windows.

OR

**Update your drivers automatically** — If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically  with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .  You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. Driver Easy handles it all.

1. [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click **Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/img_5b852d410fcf1.jpg)
3. Click**Update** next to any flagged devices to automatically download the correct version of their drivers, then you can install them manually. Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install them all automatically. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** . You get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee.)

### Fix 4: Disable or uninstall antivirus

 It’s also possible that your antivirus is blocking BattlEye. You can**close** any antivirus on your computer and**run** your game**as administrator** and see if this solves your problem.

 What does **Run as administrator** do?  
 If you run an application as administrator, you’re notifying your computer system that the application you’re going to run is safe and should be allowed with administrative privileges.

 To run your game as administrator, you can right-click on the executable (.exe) file of or the desktop shortcut to your game, and then select**Run as administrator** .
