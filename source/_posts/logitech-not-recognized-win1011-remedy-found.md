## Logitech Not Recognized: Win10/11 Remedy Found

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/img_5a8eaab2959a4-300x120.png)

 If you have a Logitech wireless mouse, and you get a message saying **Device driver software was not successfully installed** when you plug your unifying receiver into your PC, you’re not alone. Many Windows are reporting this problem as well. But no worries, this is not at all a hard problem to fix.

 If you’re bugged by this problem, no worries. Many Windows users are able to resolve it with one of the following solutions. You may not have to try them all; just work your way down until you find the one that works.

## Try these fixes, one at a time

1. [**Copy the driver file from a well-functioning computer**](https://ursime.pxf.io/r5bm57)
2. [**Remove possible conflict applications**](https://silver-cuisine.pxf.io/nlgolx)
3. [**Update mouse and USB drivers**](https://aofit.pxf.io/mmjyxq)
4. [**Run Logitech Unifying Receiver as administrator**](https://dhgate.sjv.io/5g6yb2)
5. [**Perform a hard reset**](https://martinic.evyy.net/m5azrm)

 You should get a working mouse or touchpad to do the instructions below. The following screenshots are shown on Windows 11, but all the fixes apply to Windows 10, and 8&7 as well.  

## **1: Copy the driver file from a well-functioning computer**

 If your current PC lacks the needed driver file, your mouse receiver won’t work as well as it should. To fix it:

 1) Go to   **C:\\Windows\\inf\\**  to find the**usb.PNF** and**usb.inf** files. If you can see them on your current PC, then move on to the methods below.

 2) If you can’t see them,**copy** them from another computer whose USB receiver is working properly and **paste** them onto this folder.

 3) If you don’t have another computer, see if you can find them via this path**C:\\Windows\\ System32** .

 4) If you can find the**usb.inf** and**usb.PNF** files, still, copy and paste them to the folder **C:\\Windows\\inf\\** .

## **2: Remove possible conflict applications**

 If you have MotionInJoy installed on your PC, it could be the culprit. It’s reported to conflict with Logitech unifying receiver. You can remove it:

 1) On your keyboard, hold down the Windows logo key and press R to open the Run window. Then type in**control** and hit Enter to open the**Control Panel** .

 7) Unplug your**Logitech Unifying Receiver** .

 8) Restart your computer and then plug in your Logitech Unifying Receiver.

 9) Wait for Windows Update to help you find the correct driver.

## **3: Update Mouse and USB Drivers**

 One of the most common causes of an unresponsive keyboard is an outdated mouse or USB driver.

 There are two ways you can get the right drivers for your mouse and USB port: manually or automatically.

**Manual driver update**  – You can update your drivers manually by going to the manufacturer’s website and searching for the most recent correct driver. Note that for your USB driver, you may need to try both the manufacturer of your PC and also the manufacturer of your USB port’s chipset. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your variant of Windows 10\.

**Automatic driver update**  – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with [**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .  Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact mouse and USB port, and your variant of Windows 10, and it will download and install them correctly:

 1)[**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/img_58db63a8174fd.png)

 3) Click the**Update** button next to the flagged mouse device and/or USB port to automatically download and install the correct version of that driver (you can do this with the FREE version).

 Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the [**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click_**Update All**_ ).
