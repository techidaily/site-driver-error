## Enhance Dell Clicker with Driver Update

 If the touchpad of your Dell laptop does not work correctly due to faulty drivers, updating drivers can fix the problem.

Note it is very important to download and install the right driver, as faulty driver may cause problems.

If Windows fails to update the driver, proceed to other 2 ways.

 **Way 2: Download and install the driver from Dell**

 Before you get started, ensure that you know the laptop model and the specific system that you are using (Windows 7 32-bit or Windows 7 64-bit).

 1\. Open your favourite browser and type “PC model+driver download”. Let’s take Dell Vostro 3460 for example.

 If you can’t find Windows 7 driver on the website, download the driver for Vista, which is always compatible with Windows 7\.

 After download completes, you can install the driver by just double-clicking on the setup file (.exe file) and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

 **Way 3(Recommended): Update the driver using Driver Easy**
