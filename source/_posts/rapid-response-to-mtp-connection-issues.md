## 2: Update the MTP USB Driver

 If no hardware device is at fault, it’s likely that you’re using the wrong driver altogether.

 There are two ways you can get the right drivers for your video card and monitor: manually or automatically.

**Manual driver update** – You can update your MTP USE driver manually by going to the manufacturer’s website, and searching for the most recent correct driver for it. Be sure to choose only driver that is compatible with your variant of Windows 10.
