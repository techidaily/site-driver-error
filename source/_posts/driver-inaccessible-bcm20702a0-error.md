### Fix 3 – Reinstall/update your BCM20702A0 driver

 The BCM20702A0 driver unavailable error usually occurs when the driver is corrupted, missing or outdated. To fix it, you could try reinstalling or updating the BCM20702A0 driver. And there are mainly two ways to do this:**[manually](https://uperfect.sjv.io/g1jgba)** or**[automatically](https://tokenmetrics.sjv.io/jrkzxp)** .

#### Option 1 – Update the driver manually

 You can directly download the Broadcom driver from the **[official Lenovo website](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.lenovo.com%2Fin%2Fen%2Fdownloads%2Fds104731-broadcom-bluetooth-driver-for-windows-10-64-bit-desktop)**  . Be sure to choose the driver that’s corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 64 bit).

 Once downloaded, double-click the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver on your computer manually.

#### Option 2 – Automatically update the driver

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the BCM20702A0 driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.
