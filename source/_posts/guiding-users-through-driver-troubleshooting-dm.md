## **Method 2: Update the Base System Device driver manually**

 Usually, you can go to the device manufacturer’s website or the PC manufacturer’s website to download the latest driver. But for Base System Device, it is impossible to know what the specific device is. The good news is you can get its device name and its vendor name to determine what it is.

 Follow steps below to get the device name and its vendor name.

 1) In Device Manager, right-click the device and click**Properties** .
