## Solution 1: Install the product as an administrator

 When you install the product, you’re required to install the hcmon driver. Windows may see this as a user adding hardware to the PC. But this user doesn’t have the permission to do that. In this case, this error may occur. Try to install the product as an administrator:

1) Right-click on the downloaded setup file.

2) Click**Run as administrator** . If you don’t see the option “Run as administrator”, this solution doesn’t apply to you. Skip then move on to other solutions.

 2) Go to the location where you saved the setup file. This is to get the msi name.

 3) Type**.\\xxxx.msi** in PowerShell command prompt and press**Enter** on your keyboard. XXXX means the name of msi file. Replace it with your msi file name.

In my case, my file is “VMware-VMRC-10.0.1-5898794”:
