 When you try to install the Intel Network driver, if you run into the error “ **Cannot install drivers. No Intel(R) Adapters are present in this computer** “, don’t worry. You can fix the error with one of the solutions below.

## Solution 1: Update the driver via Device Manager

**First** , ensure the driver was downloaded from [Intel official website](https://www-ssl.intel.com/content/www/us/en/homepage.html) . If you have downloaded the driver from Intel’s official website, then ensure the driver has the latest version.

 If you can’t have access to the internet due to faulty network drivers, you can download the latest driver using another PC with the network. After downloading the driver, you can save the drivers to an external drive like a USB flash drive, then you can transfer to the PC that you need to update the driver for.

 If this is the latest driver you could find from Intel, you can install the driver manually step by step via Device Manager. To do so:

1. Extract and decompress the downloaded file (**.exe**) to a folder. (You need an archive utility such as 7.zip to extract the file. If you haven’t installed a utility yet, you can download it online.)
2. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo + R keys** simultaneously to open the Run box. Type**devmgmt.msc** and hit Enter to open the Device Manager.

3. Expand the category “Network adapters”. Right-click on the Intel network device and select**Update Driver Software…**

**Note** if the network driver is missing, it might be listed under the category “Other devices”. In this case, there is a yellow mark next to the device which is probably displayed as Ethernet Controller.
4. Click**Browser my computer for driver software** .
