![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/img_58e8542d5f712.jpg) Microsoft has released Windows 10 Creators Update for early adapters who are willing to install it. We have talked about [**what new features will Microsoft bring us in the Creators Update**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/), which is the second biggest update of Windows 10\. But this update seems to have caused some problem for users with Logitech Brio Webcam.
