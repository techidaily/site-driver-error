3. Start your computer and see if the error is fixed. If not, try Fix 2, below.

### Fix 2: Update your drivers

 If Fix 1 didn’t work for you, the most likely cause is a controller or chipset driver problem.

Fortunately, this is one of the easiest problems to fix.

 There are two ways to update your controller and chipset drivers:**manually** and**automatically** .

**Update your drivers manually** — You can update your driver manually by going to the hardware manufacturer’s website, and searching for the latest driver. But if you take this approach, be sure to choose the driver that’s compatible with the exact model number of your hardware, and your version of Windows.

OR

**Update your drivers automatically** — If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.
