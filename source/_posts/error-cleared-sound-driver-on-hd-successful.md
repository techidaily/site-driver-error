## Method 3: Update the driver automatically

 The steps above may help resolve the problem. But if they don’t, you can use **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  to help update the driver automatically.

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**   and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click **Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.
