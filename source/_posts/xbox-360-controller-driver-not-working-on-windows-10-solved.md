 2) On your keyboard, press**Windows key** and**X** at the same time, then choose**Device Manager** .

 Tick the box for**Delete the driver software for this device** . Then hit**OK** to continue.
  
 6) Restart your computer after this. After the restart, plug in your device, Windows will help you install the latest version of the Xbox 360 controller that it could find. But there is no guarantee that it will find the latest version of the driver for you.
  
## **2: Update Xbox controller driver automatically (Recommended)**

 Windows only provide driver for Xbox 360 on builds earlier than Windows 7\. So if you are using Windows 10 (which is what most of you are using now), Windows 8.1 or 8, you will find the driver provided by Windows not helpful enough.

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the Xbox 360 driver manually, you can do it automatically with [**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks:

 1)[**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

 3) Click the**Update** button next to the Xbox controller driver to automatically download and install the correct version of this driver (you can do this with the FREE version).

 Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the [**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click_**Update All**_ ).
