 You may need to**repeat** this procedure with Realtek or Conexant or some other audio device and Dolby audio device.

 The notification indicates that your system needs an older version of audio driver for the audio device on it to work, so you might need to consider looking for the older version of audio drivers online.

 You could go to the official website such as Realtek or Conexant to download the driver you need ([here](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) is a post showing you how to do it on Realtek website), or go to the manufacturer of your computer to get the driver, which might requires license code in some case.
