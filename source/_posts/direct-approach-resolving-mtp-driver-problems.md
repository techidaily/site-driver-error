## 2: Update the MTP USB Driver

 If no hardware device is at fault, it’s likely that you’re using the wrong driver altogether.

 There are two ways you can get the right drivers for your video card and monitor: manually or automatically.

**Manual driver update** – You can update your MTP USE driver manually by going to the manufacturer’s website, and searching for the most recent correct driver for it. Be sure to choose only driver that is compatible with your variant of Windows 10.

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your video and monitor drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with [**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)  .  Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your USB port, and your variant of Windows 10, and it will download and install them correctly :

 1)[**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

 3) Click the Update button next to the flagged USB device to automatically download and install the correct version of its driver (you can do this with the FREE version).

 Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the [**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).
