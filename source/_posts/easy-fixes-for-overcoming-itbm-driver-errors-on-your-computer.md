### Method 2: Configure the BIOS settings

 The keys used to enter BIOS depend on the motherboard you’re using. Configuring BIOS can be risky, as incorrect settings can cause serious system problems. If you have advanced computer skills, you may be able do this on your own. If not, it’s recommended you contact the motherboard vendor for assistance.
