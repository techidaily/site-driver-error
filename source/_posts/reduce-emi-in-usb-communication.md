 But don’t worry. There are**three** methods for you to try to fix this issue. You may not have to try them all; just work your way down the list until you find the one that works for you. All steps apply to Windows 11, 10, 7, 8 & 8.1.

**Note** : If neither your USB keyboard nor the mouse work, use the touchpad, a PS2 mouse or a PS2 keyboard to perform the following procedure.

## Way 2: Update the Chipset Drivers

 To fix the problem, you can try updating the Chipset drivers. Chipset drivers are responsible for controlling communication between various components in your system like USB devices, which includes the USB drivers.

 You can go to your PC manufacturer’s website to check for and download the latest chipset drivers. To download the correct drivers, you need to know the PC model and the operating system version. Usually, you can get the PC model on the PC. To get the operating system version, click **[here](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  for the instructions.

 Alternatively, you can go to the motherboard’s website to download the chipset drivers.
