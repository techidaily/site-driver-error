## Solved HP Bluetooth Driver Issue in Windows 10

After upgrading to Windows 10, if your bluetooth devices cannot be recognized by your HP computer, check the driver status in [Device Manager](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/). The problem mostly is caused by driver issues. If you see a yellow mark next to the device, there is driver problem with the device. To fix the problem, update the driver. There are 2 ways you can use to update the bluetooth driver.
