## Solved HP Bluetooth Driver Issue in Windows 10

After upgrading to Windows 10, if your bluetooth devices cannot be recognized by your HP computer, check the driver status in [Device Manager](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/). The problem mostly is caused by driver issues. If you see a yellow mark next to the device, there is driver problem with the device. To fix the problem, update the driver. There are 2 ways you can use to update the bluetooth driver. [Way 1: Download and install the driver from HP](https://twopages.pxf.io/21em1d) [Way 2: Update driver using Driver Easy](https://aspironcom.sjv.io/kj14en)   **How to download and install the driver from HP**  Before you get started, ensure that you know the PC model and the specific system that your computer is running (Windows 10 32-bit or Windows 10 64-bit).  1\.
