## Fix Lenovo Y570 Driver Issues for Windows 10

After upgrading to Windows 10, if you meet driver problems with your Lenovo Y570, don’t worry, try tips here and the problem should resolve.  
  
 **First, download and install Windows 10 driver from device’s manufacturer**
  
Usually, to update drivers, it is recommended to go to PC manufacturer’s website to download the latest driver, which would be most compatible with the device. For Lenovo Y570, you may have noticed that there are no Windows 10 compatible drivers on [Lenovo’s official website.](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=http%3A%2F%2Fsupport.lenovo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fproducts%2Flaptops-and-netbooks%2Fideapad-y-series-laptops%2Fideapad-y570%3Fquery%3D%26Shallow%3D1%26Type%3D%26OperatingSystems%3D%26Component%3D%26Symptom%3D%26%26beta%3Dfalse) Support for this model is up to Windows 8\. In this case, go to the device’s manufacturer’s website to download the Windows 10 driver. For instance, if your Lenovo Y570 is missing Intel WiFi driver, go to Intel’s website to download the Windows 10 driver according to the wireless card model.  
  
 **Secondly, download and install Windows 7 or Windows 8 driver from Lenovo**
  
Since no Windows 10 drivers for this PC model are released, try installing Windows 7 or Windows 8 drivers, which are always compatible with Windows 10\. Click [here](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=http%3A%2F%2Fsupport.lenovo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fproducts%2FLaptops-and-netbooks%2FIdeaPad-Y-Series-laptops%2FIdeaPad-Y570%3Fquery%3D%26Shallow%3D1%26Type%3D%26OperatingSystems%3D%26Component%3D%26Symptom%3D%26tabName%3DDownloads%26linkTrack%3DMast%3ASubNav%3ASupport%3ADrivers%2520and%2520Software%7CDrivers%2520and%2520Software%26beta%3Dfalse) to go to the driver download site.

Downloaded drivers are always in self-install format, which allows you to install by just double-clicking on the setup file (.exe). In Windows 10, if you can’t install the Windows 7 or Windows 8 driver successfully in this way, you might need to install the driver manually step by step.  
  
Following steps are for your reference how to install the driver manually step by step.
