 **Option One: Install Update for Windows 10 Insider Preview (KB3061161)**

If you don’t see such an update, don’t freak out, just go to Microsoft and get in downloaded and installed, and you will be fine.
  
**Option Two**:**Update Bluetooth Driver Manually**
  
**Note** : You can of course download the Bluetooth driver in some other way. For example, you can type the model name of your Qualcomm Atheros in the search box on Google and find the driver. But there is no guarantee that the driver found and downloaded is compatible with your PC or that it is trust-worthy. So, it is highly suggested that you download drivers from the manufacturer website.
  
 1) Go to the support website of the manufacture of your PC. We are using**ASUS** as an example. Then locate the support page of your PC by entering the model of your product.
  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/img_587854520d556.jpg)

2) Then go to drivers section. (The name of the section could be different on different manufacturers’ websites.) You will be asked to select what operating system that you are using (we are going**Windows 10 64-bit**), and then a list of device drivers will be shown. Scroll down a little to choose**Qualcomm Atheros Bluetooth**driver under Bluetooth category. Then hit the**Global**button to get it downloaded.
  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/img_5878567811d29.png)

**Note**: If your PC is rather old and there is no such Bluetooth driver that you can find for Windows 10, it is suggested that you give the latest version of driver that you can find a try, be it Windows 8.1, Windows 8, or Windows 7\. Then try [**install the driver in compatibility mode**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/).
  
3) Now press**Windows key**and**X**at the same time and choose**Device Manager**.
  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/img_5878625e408ff.png)

4) Then locate and expand category**Bluetooth**. Right click the**Qualcomm Atheros Bluetooth driver**you have and choose**Uninstall**.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/img_5878700f160fd.jpg)

5) When prompted with the following notification, tick the box for**Delete the driver software for this device**and then hit**OK**to continue.
  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/img_58787077d9b1c.png)

6) When the uninstall finishes, restart your computer.
  
7) Now, go to the folder where you store the setup file of the Qualcomm Atheros Bluetooth driver, double the**setup file**and run the installation as instructed.

8) When the install finishes, reboot your computer for the change to take effect.
  
 **Option Three: Reinstall Bluetooth Driver Manually**
  
 If the above methods don’t help, you might need to try reinstall the driver by yourself.
  
 1) You need to download compatible Bluetooth driver for your PC from the Internet first.

6) Un-tick the box for **Show compatible hardware** . Then you should be able to see **Qualcomm Atheros** driver option on the left. On the right, choose one of the drivers listed. We go with**Qualcomm Atheros AR3011 Bluetooth 3.0** . You need to try them one by one by yourself to select the right one for your PC. When done picking, click**Next** to continue.

7)Then follow the instructions on screen to get your Qualcomm Atheros Bluetooth drive installed.  
  
8) When install finishes, please make sure to restart your computer for the change to take effect.  

 **Option Four: Update Bluetooth Driver Automatically (Recommended)**
  
If installing the driver using compatibility mode and reinstall the driver didn’t help, you might need to consider updating the current driver. But as mentioned above, you might find it very challenging to find the correct driver for your PC.
  
Why not have a try at [**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/), a driver updater that automatically detects, downloads and installs device drivers automatically.
