 If you’re on Windows 7 and you see the error message saying No driver found after you pair up your Bluetooth devices, you’re not alone. Many Windows users are reporting this problem as well. But no worries, it’s possible to fix.

 Here are 3 fixes for you to try. You may not have to try them all; just work your way down until you find the one works for you.

 **Method 1:[Update Driver Manually](https://aidotcom.pxf.io/nkz4kv)**
 **Method 2:[Update Drivers Automatically (Recommended)](#m2)**
 **Method 3:[Use Microsoft Mobile Device](https://proteahair.pxf.io/znernm)**

## 1: Update Driver Manually

 One of the first things you do when you see notification like this is to update your Bluetooth device drivers.

 You can do the update via Device Manager, Windows Update, or go straight to the manufacturer support website. But you should only do so when you are certain about what you are doing.
