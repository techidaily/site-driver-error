This method is reported useful according to some users, so we include it here for you to have a try.

Your laptop seems to remain in a sleep state after you have opened the lid. To fix the problem, you need press the**Windows key**to invoke the**Start**panel, then use the**left arrow key**to navigate to the**Shut Down, Hibernate, Log Out, Lock** and**Sleep**functions. Choose Sleep and let your laptop go to sleep. Once it is in a sleep state, hit the**Esc**key and it will wake up with the touchpad mouse function restored.
