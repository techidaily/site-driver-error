![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/img_59535a6998cff.jpg)

 Unknown Device issue is the common issue after Windows upgrade especially when you upgrade to Windows 10\. It is also common in Windows 7\.  You can fix this issue by updating the drivers.

[**Way 1: Update the driver via Device Manager**](https://bluettieu.pxf.io/nlgoka)
[**Way 2: Download and Install the driver Manually**](https://copa.sjv.io/6eoowq)
[**Way 3 (Recommended): Update the driver using Driver Easy**](#way3)

## Way 1: Update the driver via Device Manager

 You don’t need to know that the Unknown Device is if you update the driver via Device Manager. In this way, Windows will identify and install the driver automatically. Follow these steps:

 1\. Open **[Device Manager](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 2\. Right-click on the**Unknown device** and click**Update Driver Software** .

## Way 2: Download and Install the driver Manually

 If you download driver from the PC manufacturer or the device manufacturer, you at least need to identify the device name. But for Unknown device, it is impossible to get their device name directly. In this case, it is hard or impossible to find the right driver. Fortunately, every device has its own hardware id. You can use the hardware id to identify the unknown device then find the right driver.

Follow steps below to get the hardware id of the unknown device.

 1\. Go to**Device Manager** .

 2\. Right-click on the**Unknown device** and click**Properties** .

 3\. Click**Details** tab and click the drop down menu of**Property** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/img_59535ea39bc34.png)

 Select**Hardware Ids** from the drop down menu and the value field will pop up with a list of values.

 Right-click on the top-most value and choose**Copy** from the menu.

 After that, paste the value into the search engine you like and you’ll identify the unknown device. Then you can go to the PC manufacturer’s website or the device manufacturer’s website to download the driver you need. Note you need to know the version of Windows in order to download the correct driver.
