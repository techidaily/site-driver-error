### Fix 4: Update the keyboard driver

 If reinstalling the keyboard driver doesn’t work, you should update your keyboard driver to see if it fixes your problem. There are two ways you can update your keyboard driver:

#### Option 1:**Manually**

 You can go to the manufacturer’s website of your keyboard, find exactly the right driver, download it, and install it step by step.

#### Option 2:**Automatically (Recommended)**

 If you don’t have the time, patience, or skills to update the driver manually, you can**do it automatically** with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the**FREE** or the**Pro** version of Driver Easy. But with the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) ,** it takes just 2 steps (and you get full support and it comes with a 30-day money-back**guarantee**):

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/2019-09-24_10-03-23-1.png)

 3) Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro Version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/image-47.png)

**Note** : You can do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.

4) Restart your computer to take effect.

 Try the Enter key again to see if it works. If so, then congrats! If the issue remains, please move on to the next fix.

 Did the fixes above successfully solve your Enter key not working issue? If not, you can try updating your Windows. But if these all fail, then it’s very likely a hardware failure problem that might be better left with professional hands.
