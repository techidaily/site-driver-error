 If you’re on Windows, and you’re seeing this error saying**Can’t find the name of Intel ICD OpenGL driver** , you’re not alone. Many Windows users are reporting it. But the good news is you can fix it easily by yourself with this guide.

2. **[Download a latest graphics driver from Intel website manually](https://bluettiit.sjv.io/xkwq91)**

## Option 1: Update your Intel graphics driver automatically
