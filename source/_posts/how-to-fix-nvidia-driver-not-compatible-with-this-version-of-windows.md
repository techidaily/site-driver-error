 If you are having issue installing drivers for GeForce GTX 1080 on Windows 10, don’t worry, as this is a known issue especially for version 368.25\. You can install the driver successfully with the solutions in this article.

 This graphics driver could not find compatible graphics hardware.”

There are 2 solutions for you to fix the problem:

 **Solution 1:[Update the driver using Driver Easy](https://vapordna.pxf.io/vnbxna)**
 **Solution 2:[Install a higher version of Windows 10](https://getlyla.pxf.io/ek9gkg)**
