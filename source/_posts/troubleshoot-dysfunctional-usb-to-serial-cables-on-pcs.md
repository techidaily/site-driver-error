### Solution 1: Update your Prolific USB to Serial driver to the latest version

 You can update your Prolific USB to Serial driver to the latest version either manually or automatically.

1. **Manual driver update –** You can update your Prolific USB to Serial driver manually by going to the official [Prolific website](http://www.prolific.com.tw/US/ShowProduct.aspx?pcid=41&showlevel=0041-0041) , and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose the only driver that is compatible with your Windows version.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/img_5bb06e0d6f148.jpg)
2. **Automatic driver update –** If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update your Prolific USB to Serial driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your exact Prolific adapter, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:
1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/img_5bb0704ce6b75.jpg)
3. Click**Update** next to the flagged Prolific USB to Serial driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the**FREE** version).  
 Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.

### Solution 2: Roll your Prolific USB to Serial driver back to an older version

 You may note that up-to-date drivers always keep your devices working in the best condition. But sometimes the latest driver doesn’t work with old hardware.

 When you upgrade your older Windows system to the latest version or perform updates directly on Windows, the Prolific USB to Serial driver also gets updated, and if it doesn’t work with your old hardware, you might have this problem. So you can try to**downgrade your Prolific USB to Serial driver** .

Here’s how you can do it:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo + R keys** simultaneously to open the Run dialog box.
2. Type**devmgmt.msc** and hit Enter.

3. Double-click**Ports(COM & LPT)** , then**right-click** on your Prolific USB to Serial driver to select**Update driver** .

4. Click**Browse my computer for driver software** .![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/img_5bb075c361cc6.png)
5. Select**Let me pick from a list of available drivers on my computer** .![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/img_5bb075da68269.png)
6. Select an older version on the Model list. Then**Next** .![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/img_5bb076059c302.jpg)

 Then the driver you select would be installed on your Windows 10 computer automatically.

Once it’s done, connect your device again and see if it goes well.
