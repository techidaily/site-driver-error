## Method 2: Make sure you have the correct compatible version driver for your Windows

 To enable your device to work properly in Windows, your device driver should be compatible with your system. For example, if you use a 64 bit Windows 10 operating system, your device driver should be compatible with this version. In other words, if your device driver is for 32 bit Windows 10 or Windows 7, Code 37 may occur.

 You can go with these following steps to make sure you have the correct version of your device driver:

 1) On your keyboard, press the   **Windows logo key ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/win-key.png)**  and **R**  at the same time to invoke the Run box.

 2) Type **devmgmt.msc**  and click **OK** .

 3) Right-click on your device with Code 37 error, then click **Uninstall device** .

 4) Go to your device manufacturer’s website or the one of your computer manufacturer, and find the correct version of your device driver. Then download it to install on your computer.

**Note:**  If you have trouble with looking for the correct driver, you can use [Method 3](https://printrendy.pxf.io/xyboy5) to help your find the driver automatically.

 5) Restart your computer and check to see if your device status is normal.

## Method 3: Update your device driver automatically

 The methods above may solve your problem, but if they don’t or, if you’re not confident playing around with drivers manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version, it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money-back guarantee):

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**   and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click**Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3) Click **Update**  next to your flagged device driver to automatically download and install the correct version of this driver (you can do this with the FREE version).

Or click **Update All**  to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_  the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the Pro version – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).
