 If you discover this error saying   **Windows cannot initialize the device driver for this hardware(Code 37)**  of your device in Device Manager, don’t be worried. Many Windows users are reporting it. The good news is you can fix it easily with this guide.

 Here are 3 methods you can try to fix this problem. You may not have to try them all; just work your way down until you find the one that works.

 **Method 1:[Scan for hardware changes in Device Manager](https://tokenmetrics.sjv.io/jrkzxp)**
 **Method 2:[Make sure you have the correct compatible version driver for your Windows](https://pish-posh-baby.sjv.io/g1jg15)**
 **Method 3:[Update your device driver automatically](https://eimmie.pxf.io/21emk7)**

## Method 2: Make sure you have the correct compatible version driver for your Windows

 To enable your device to work properly in Windows, your device driver should be compatible with your system. For example, if you use a 64 bit Windows 10 operating system, your device driver should be compatible with this version. In other words, if your device driver is for 32 bit Windows 10 or Windows 7, Code 37 may occur.

 You can go with these following steps to make sure you have the correct version of your device driver:

 1) On your keyboard, press the   **Windows logo key ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/win-key.png)**  and **R**  at the same time to invoke the Run box.

 2) Type **devmgmt.msc**  and click **OK** .
