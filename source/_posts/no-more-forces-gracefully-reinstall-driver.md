### Step 3: Change your BIOS settings

 But if reinstalling the graphics driver doesn’t fix the**Force to reinstall the graphics driver** issue, the culprit might be your BIOS settings.

 If your motherboard only supports up to PCIe Gen3, but your BIOS revision gives Gen4 as an option, you might bump into this error especially when your slot is set to**Auto** .

 PCIe (Peripheral Component Interconnect Express) is a high-speed interface standard for connecting additional graphics cards (GPUs), Local Area Network (LAN) ports, NVME solid-state drives (SSDs), Universal Serial Bus (USB) ports, and other hardware to a computer’s motherboard.

 Therefore, the quickest fix is that you should go into your BIOS and manually set the**PCIe Slot Configuration** to**Gen3** .

 After setting your PCIe slot to Gen3, your computer should be fine now. But if te keeps giving you**Force to reinstall graphics driver** error or BSOD issues, you can [**update your BIOS**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .
