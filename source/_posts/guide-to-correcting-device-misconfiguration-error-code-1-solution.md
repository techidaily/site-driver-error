 In Device Manager, if you get error “**This device is not configured correctly (Code 1)** ” with your device, don’t worry. You can fix the problem by following the instructions in this article.

 This is a driver related problem. To resolve the problem, you just need to update the driver. There are two methods you can update the driver. You can try Method 1 first. If Method 1 doesn’t work, try Method 2\.

1. [**Update the driver manually via Device Manager**](https://malaysia-healthcare-travel-council.pxf.io/752oeg)
2. [**Update the driver automatically**](https://atezr.pxf.io/752omg)

## Method 1: Update the driver manually via Device Manager

 You can update the driver via Device Manager. Follow these steps (Here take steps in Windows 7 as reference, which also apply to Windows 10, 8, 8.1, XP & Vista.):  
  
 1) Open Device Manager.

 2) Right-click on the problem device with the code error 1 and click **Update Driver**
 **Software… (In some cases, this could be Update driver.)**

##  Method 2: Update the driver automatically

 If Method 1 doesn’t work for you, or if you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**   and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click **Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.
