3. Among the driver releases, make sure to **ONLY**   choose drivers that are both most up-to-date and compatible with **your variant of Windows Operating System** .
4. Run the downloaded file to finish the install.
5. **Restart**   your computer and don‚Äôt forget to c heck**Device Manager** and see if the **No drivers installed for this device** problem has been fixed.
