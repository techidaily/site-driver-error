**``  Case 2: Your keyboard and mouse are not working.**

 Your usb keyboard and mouse would stop working if the USB 3.0 drivers are missing or corrupted. In this case, it is impossible to use them to download and install the new drivers. But don’t worry. You can update the drivers anyway by following methods below.

````
```` **Method 1: Plug and replug the keyboard and mouse**

 To make the keyboard and the mouse work again, unplug then plug them again. After replugging, Windows will load the USB 3.0 drivers automatically. When the keyboard and mouse works properly, you can use them to update the ASMedia USB 3.0 eXtensible Host Controller drivers.

 ```` **Method 2: Enter Safe Mode to delete the drivers**

 Though you can’t use the keyboard and mouse in Normal mode, you can use them in Safe Mode (See [How to Enter Safe Mode](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) ). It is recommended that you enter Safe Mode with Networking so you can search for and update the drivers in Safe Mode.  
````
```` Deleting the USB 3.0 drivers in Safe Mode probably would fix the issues. Follow steps below to delete the USB 3.0 drivers in Safe Mode. Normally, Safe Mode will at least allow you to use the keyboard. If you can’t use the mouse, use the keyboard instead.
````
```` 1) On your keyboard, press**Win+R** (Windows logo key and R key) at the same time to invoke the run box.
````
```` 2) Type **devmgmt.msc** and tap the **OK** button.

Use the**Down Arrow** ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/img_58c771c5be79a.png) key to move to the category the use the**Right Arrow** ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/img_58c771f6a3a58.png) key to expand the category.)
**``** ``
 4) Press**Del** (**Delete** On some keyboards)key to delete the driver.
`` ``
`` `` 5) Restart your computer then the keyboard and mouse should work properly.
