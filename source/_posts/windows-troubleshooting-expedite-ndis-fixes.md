## Windows Troubleshooting: Expedite NDIS Fixes

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image-231.png)

 If you ever encountered an NDIS driver issue, don’t worry – you’re not alone. Usually you can solve this type of problems by updating the NDIS drivers, which is not hard to perform.

## How to update NDIS drivers

There are mainly two ways you can update your NDIS drivers:

**[Option 1 – Update drivers via Device Manager](https://electronicx.pxf.io/xkwqkk)**  – This is the most common method to update your driver, but sometimes Windows may fail to provide you with the latest (and even necessary) device drivers.

OR

**[Option 2 – Update drivers via Driver Easy (Recommended)](#option2)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

## Option 1 – Update drivers via Device Manager

 To update your NDIS driver via Device Manger, here’s the procedure:

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows Logo key** ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/img_5ae0331bc08e4-4.png) and **R** at the same time to invoke the Run dialog box. Type **devmgmt.msc** and click **OK** .![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2019-06-17_14-24-52-1.png)
2. In the Device Manager window, double-click**Network adapters** to expand its drop-down list. Select your NDIS device, right-click on it, and click**Update driver** in the context menu.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2019-08-14_12-05-33.jpg)
3. Click **Search automatically for updated driver software** . Then follow the onscreen instructions to update your driver.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2019-08-14_17-56-38.jpg)
4. Wait for the update to be completed. Then**reboot** your PC for the changes to take effect.

## Option 2 – Update drivers via Device Manager
