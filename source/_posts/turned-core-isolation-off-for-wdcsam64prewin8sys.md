 Then restart your computer and see if**_wdcsam64\_prewin8.sys_** is still listed as an incompatible file that stops Memory Integrity from working properly. If the problem remains, please move on.

## 2\. Reinstall the wdcsam64\_prewin8.sys driver

 wdcsam64\_prewin8.sys is a driver file from Western Digital Technologies, a hard drive manufacturer. So when Core Isolation reminds you that wdcsam64\_prewin8.sys is incompatible, you may have some problem with the drivers for your hard drives. If you don’t recall any hard drive from Western Digital, it’s probably pre-installed on your computer.

 Whether you have the WD hard drive(s) pre-installed, or you have one or two WD hard drives installed yourself, you can do the following for the mentioned incompatible driver to be reinstalled by Windows:

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows** key and the **R** key at the same time. Type **cmd**  and hit **Ctrl+Shift+Enter** to open Command Prompt as administrator. When prompted for permission, click **Yes** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-49.png)
2. Type this command: **`pnputil.exe -d oem<NUMBER>.inf`**  and hit **Enter** .  

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 The**`<NUMBER>`** here should be filled with the number you see on your computer. For instance, I’m seeing **16** , so my command here should be **`pnputil.exe -d oem16.inf`** .  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-72.png)
3. This is what the command looks like on my computer.  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-74.png)  
 Hit **Enter**  when the command is typed in.

4. When you see **Driver package deleted successfully** , restart your computer for the wdcsam64\_prewin8.sys driver to be installed automatically by Windows again.

 Go to Core Isolation and see if**_wdcsam64\_prewin8.sys_** is still regarded as an incompatible driver that stops Memory Integrity from turning on. If so, please move on.

## 3\. Manually download and install the wdcsam64\_prewin8.sys driver

 According to a post on the WD forum, WD has recognized this problem, i.e. dcsam64\_prewin8.sys being incompatible and turning off Memory Integrity, and they’ve since released a new driver, which can be downloaded from here:[https://downloads.wdc.com/wdapp/Install_WD_Discovery_for_Windows.zip](https://downloads.wdc.com/wdapp/Install%5FWD%5FDiscovery%5Ffor%5FWindows.zip)

 After the driver file download, unzip the folder, and double-click the setup file in it to run the driver installation:
