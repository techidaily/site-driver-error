 When you install the product, you’re required to install the hcmon driver. Windows may see this as a user adding hardware to the PC. But this user doesn’t have the permission to do that. In this case, this error may occur. Try to install the product as an administrator:

1) Right-click on the downloaded setup file.

2) Click**Run as administrator** . If you don’t see the option “Run as administrator”, this solution doesn’t apply to you. Skip then move on to other solutions.
