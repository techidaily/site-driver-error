## To Do so by C:\n; and I Need to Check_2 Is Not Foundations of an Image

 If you’re having “**Windows Hello isn’t available on this device.** ” in your **Settings** windows, you’re not alone. Many Windows 10 users are reporting this problem as well. No worries, it’s possible to fix. Here is the 3-step fixes for you to fix your problem.

### **What is Windows Hello?**

**Windows Hello** allows you to login into your system by recognizing your fingerprint or your face or your iris (like Surface) rather than using a pin code or a password, provided that you have a webcam and a finger scanner that work.  
  
 With Windows 10 Anniversary Update, this feature has extended to apps and websites, which include banking apps and other sensitive apps.

### **How do I fix it?**

 Here are 3 solutions for you to try. You may not have to try them all; just work your way down until you find the one works for you.
  
[**1. Update Your PC**](https://silver-cuisine.pxf.io/nlgolx) [**2\. Enable Biometric from Administration**](#2)
[**3\. Update Your Fingerprint Device Driver**](#3)

## **Step 1: Update Your PC**

 First of all, make sure that you’ve installed any possible update that is available for Windows 10\. See if you have needed patches installed:

 1) On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**I** at the same time. Click **Update & security** .

When you finish, move on to the second step.
  
## **Step 2: Enable Biometric from Administration**

 If you don’t have the administrator permission, you’re not likely to use Windows Hello on your PC. To fix it:

 1) On your keyboard, press **the Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time, then type **gpedit.msc** and press **Enter** .

 4) Reboot your computer and then move on to the next step.

## **Step 3: Update Your Fingerprint Device Driver**

 If your fingerprint device driver is outdated or faulty, you’ll find the hardware impossible to use. You can update the device driver to fix it.

 1) On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** and**X** at the same time, and click **Device Manager** .

 4) You can choose to reboot your computer for Windows to help you locate the driver that it could find for your device.  
  
 Or, as an alternative, you can choose to update the driver by yourself.
