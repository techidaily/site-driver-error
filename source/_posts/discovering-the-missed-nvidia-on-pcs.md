## Fix 3: Update your BIOS

**BIOS**   (**Basic Input/Output System**) performs the hardware initialization and jumpstarts the processes during the booting process of your computer. So we can try updating our **BIOS**   to see if it solves this   **graphics card not showing up in Device Manager in Windows 10/8/7**   issue.

**Important** : Updating BIOS incorrectly might incur loss of data or even more serious problems. So**please proceed with caution or seek professional help** in the **BIOS updating process** .

 If you need help updating your BIOS, here are some posts that you can refer to:

## Fix 4: Repair corrupted system files

 If you are facing persistent issues and none of the previous solutions have proven effective, it is possible that your corrupted system files are to blame. To rectify this, repairing the system files becomes crucial. The System File Checker (SFC) tool can assist you in this process. By executing the “sfc /scannow” command, you can initiate a scan that identifies problems and repairs missing or corrupted system files. However, it is important to note that **the SFC tool primarily focuses on scanning major files and may overlook minor issues** .

 In situations where the SFC tool falls short, a more powerful and specialized Windows repair tool is recommended.[**Fortect**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) is an automated Windows repair tool that excels in identifying problematic files and replacing malfunctioning ones. By scanning your PC comprehensively, Fortect can provide a more comprehensive and effective solution for repairing your Windows system.

1. [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Fortect.
2. Open Fortectand run a free scan of your PC. Wait a few minutes, and it will give you a detailed report of your PC status.
