 Razer mouse freezing can affect your productivity while you’re doing something at work and may spoil your fun when you’re in a game. But you won’t need to worry about it since this tutorial will show why your Razer mouse is malfunctioning and how to fix Razer mouse freezing on Windows 10,8,7 quickly.

##  You might be experiencing…

 Many users have reported that their Razer mouse is freezing every few seconds on Windows and it’s quite random.

* **The cursor is freezing when typing**  
 This is basically the same thing as the issue above. Although it looks strange, this issue is very easy to solve.
* **The cursor won’t move**  
 Sometimes the freezing went worse and the cursor just got stuck in one place no matter how you move it.
* **The cursor jumps around**  
 It can be really annoying when your mouse cursor is doing this to you. This happens occasionally, and it can be fixed.
* **The cursor disappears**  
 Odds are that the cursor freezes and disappears completely. For the most time, it’s caused by a faulty driver. If you’re experiencing this, unplug your Razer mouse and re-plug it in. But if this didn’t work, you can solve it with the solutions below.

##  Why is my Razer mouse freezing

**A faulty mouse driver** is one of the many possible reasons why this issue is happening. Drivers are like interpreters between Windows and your devices.

 Typically a mouse driver has the information of the current mouse state (position and button states) and tells them to the operating system or the application when you move. So that’s why your Razer mouse is acting up such as freezing, there’s a good chance updating your mouse driver will fix it.

 Besides, it can be caused by**third-party interference** or**faulty system settings** . But no matter what the culprit is, we’ve put together all the possible fixes you can fix your Razer mouse freezing quickly.
