**[Option Three: Reinstall Bluetooth Driver Manually](https://laganoo.pxf.io/5g6ygn)**
**[Option Four: Update Bluetooth Driver Automatically (Recommended)](#4)**
  
 **Option One: Install Update for Windows 10 Insider Preview (KB3061161)**
  
 On Windows 10 forum, one of the technicians said that this problem is with Windows 10\. So to fix this problem, it is suggested that you update one of Windows update package, **KB3061161** , to help fix your Qualcomm Atheros Bluetooth driver error.

 Scroll down to see if you can find the**KB3061161** . It should be a rather old update, so it might cost you some time to locate.

If you don’t see such an update, don’t freak out, just go to Microsoft and get in downloaded and installed, and you will be fine.
  
**Option Two**:**Update Bluetooth Driver Manually**
  
**Note** : You can of course download the Bluetooth driver in some other way. For example, you can type the model name of your Qualcomm Atheros in the search box on Google and find the driver. But there is no guarantee that the driver found and downloaded is compatible with your PC or that it is trust-worthy. So, it is highly suggested that you download drivers from the manufacturer website.
  
 1) Go to the support website of the manufacture of your PC. We are using**ASUS** as an example. Then locate the support page of your PC by entering the model of your product.
  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/img_587854520d556.jpg)

2) Then go to drivers section. (The name of the section could be different on different manufacturers’ websites.) You will be asked to select what operating system that you are using (we are going**Windows 10 64-bit**), and then a list of device drivers will be shown. Scroll down a little to choose**Qualcomm Atheros Bluetooth**driver under Bluetooth category. Then hit the**Global**button to get it downloaded.

**Note**: If your PC is rather old and there is no such Bluetooth driver that you can find for Windows 10, it is suggested that you give the latest version of driver that you can find a try, be it Windows 8.1, Windows 8, or Windows 7\. Then try [**install the driver in compatibility mode**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/).
  
3) Now press**Windows key**and**X**at the same time and choose**Device Manager**.
