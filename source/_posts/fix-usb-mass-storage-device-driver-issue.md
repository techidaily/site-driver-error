 4) Restart your PC. Then Windows will reinstall the driver.  
  
## **Solution 2: Update the Driver**

 If the problem persists after updating the driver, please try updating the driver. Go to your PC manufacturer’s website to download the latest USB driver. To locate the right driver, you need to know the PC model and the operating system version (See [How to Get Operating System Version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) ).  
  
 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .  
  
 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.
