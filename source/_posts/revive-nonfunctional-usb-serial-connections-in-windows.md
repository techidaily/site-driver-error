### Solution 2: Roll your Prolific USB to Serial driver back to an older version

 You may note that up-to-date drivers always keep your devices working in the best condition. But sometimes the latest driver doesn’t work with old hardware.

 When you upgrade your older Windows system to the latest version or perform updates directly on Windows, the Prolific USB to Serial driver also gets updated, and if it doesn’t work with your old hardware, you might have this problem. So you can try to**downgrade your Prolific USB to Serial driver** .

Here’s how you can do it:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo + R keys** simultaneously to open the Run dialog box.
2. Type**devmgmt.msc** and hit Enter.
