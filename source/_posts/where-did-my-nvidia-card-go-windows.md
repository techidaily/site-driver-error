## Fix 4: Repair corrupted system files

 If you are facing persistent issues and none of the previous solutions have proven effective, it is possible that your corrupted system files are to blame. To rectify this, repairing the system files becomes crucial. The System File Checker (SFC) tool can assist you in this process.

However, it is important to note that **the SFC tool primarily focuses on scanning major files and may overlook minor issues** .
