## Why this error occurs?

 You must wonder why this error would occur as you downloaded the driver from Intel official website. Read on then you’ll know why.

 To update Intel drivers, you can download the new driver not only from the Intel but also from the computer manufacturer. Intel supplies the generic versions of drivers for the generic purpose. And the computer manufacturer changes and customizes the Intel generic drivers in order to get the hardware work at its best performance.

## Way 1: Install the driver from computer manufacturer

 Since you can’t install the Intel generic graphics driver, go to the computer manufacturer’s website to check and download the new driver.

**NOTE:** The computer manufacturer may have stopped providing support for your PC model. In this case, this way doesn’t work for you. Move on and use another way.
