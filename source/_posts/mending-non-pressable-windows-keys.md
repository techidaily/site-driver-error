### Fix 4: Update the keyboard driver

 If reinstalling the keyboard driver doesn’t work, you should update your keyboard driver to see if it fixes your problem. There are two ways you can update your keyboard driver:

#### Option 1:**Manually**

 You can go to the manufacturer’s website of your keyboard, find exactly the right driver, download it, and install it step by step.

#### Option 2:**Automatically (Recommended)**

 If you don’t have the time, patience, or skills to update the driver manually, you can**do it automatically** with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the**FREE** or the**Pro** version of Driver Easy. But with the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) ,** it takes just 2 steps (and you get full support and it comes with a 30-day money-back**guarantee**):

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.
