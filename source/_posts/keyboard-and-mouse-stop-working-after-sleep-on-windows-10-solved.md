## Keyboard & Mouse Stop Working After Sleep on Windows 10 [Solved]

 If you’re on Windows 10 and your mouse and keyboard stop working after your PC wake from sleep, you’re not alone. Many Windows users are reporting this problem as well. But no worries, it’s possible to fix.

 Here are 3 solutions for you to try. You may not have to try them all; just work your way down until you find the one works for you.

**[1: Disable Automatic Driver Updates](https://bluettifr.pxf.io/bax2bv)**
**[2: Reinstall Mouse and Keyboard Drivers](https://collovinc.sjv.io/jrkzwp)**
**[3: Change the Settings in Power Management](https://turtlebeachus.sjv.io/vmebyo)**

**Note** that you need to have a workable mouse or pen to perform the following methods.

## **1: Disable Automatic Driver Updates**

 It is suspected that auto driver updates in**Windows Update** is causing this problem.

 Even though Windows Update alleges to install the correct drivers, it is not uncommon that a lot of users have bad drivers provided by Windows which cause sorts of problems. Sometimes, Windows Update will replace the manual update drivers with its own drivers, which is unacceptable for some PCs.

 To fix your mouse and keyboard not working issue, you need to disable automatic driver updates from Windows.
  
 1) Click the**Start** button on your keyboard and click **Control Panel** .
  
 2) View by **Category** , click **System and Security** .

## **2: Reinstall Mouse and Keyboard Drivers**

 Faulty or outdated mouse and keyboard drivers is very likely to be the cause of this problem. You should verify that your mouse and keyboard have the right drivers, and update if they don’t.
