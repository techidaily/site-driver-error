 Usually, the**Event ID 219 driver wudfrd failed to load error** is caused by a wrong device driver on your computer. You can easily fix it by solving the driver issue on your computer. If you’re interested in knowing more about this error code, feel free to visit **[Event ID 219 is logged when a device is plugged into a Windows-based system](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-client/setup-upgrade-and-drivers/event-id-219-when-device-plugged-in-windows-system)**

Here are two methods to fix the driver problem titled event ID 219:

1. **[Find the misbehaved driver and update it manually](https://getlyla.pxf.io/ek9gkg)**
2. [**Solve your driver problem via Driver Easy automatically (Recommended)**](#Method2)

## Method 1: Find the misbehaved driver and update it manually

 To update the driver manually, you’ll first need to know what driver to update, then update it in Device Manager. To do so:

1. When you see the**Event ID 219 driver wudfrd failed to load error** in Event Viewer, you should also see the hardware ID for the device that’s having this problem. For instance, in this screenshot, the problematic device is with the hardware ID**PCI\\VEN\_8086&DEV\_15EB** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Event-ID-219-driver-wudfrd-failed-to-load-error-.png)
2. When searching on Google for the hardware ID, the device name should be Intel JHL7540 Thunderbolt 3 NHI \[Titan Ridge 4C 2018\](or Thunderbolt(TM) Controller – 15EB):  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/hardware-id-on-google.png)
3. Then you need to locate the device on your computer in Device Manager.
4. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo** key +**R** key together to open a Run box. Then type**devmgmt.msc** in the box and hit**Enter** to open Device Manager.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/win-run-device-manager.jpg)
5. On the pop-up Device Manager window, see if you can find any entries marked with**a yellow exclamation mark** . like here on the screenshot:  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/img_596718add428c.png)  

 If so, there you go, you’ve found the device driver that’s giving out the Event ID 129 error.
6. If you don’t see any entries with the yellow exclamation mark, use the device name information you have from step 2\. For instance, the problematic driver on my computer is**Thunderbolt(TM) Controller – 15EB** , and when I search “**Thunderbolt(TM) Controller – 15EB device manager** ” on Google, the results tell me that I should look under the**System devices** category in Device Manager.
7. After you find out which driver is to blame for the error, right-click on the driver and select**Update driver** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/img_59671c4e07788.png)
8. Click Search automatically for updated driver software.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/img_5b4ff6553f6f3.png)
9. Then Windows will detect the update for your device driver automatically.

 If you have multiple device drivers in Device Manager marked with a yellow exclamation make, please repeat the above to make sure that they’re all updated. But checking drivers one by one in Device Manager is really time-consuming and annoying. If you want to solve the problem quickly and easily, use Method 2 then.
