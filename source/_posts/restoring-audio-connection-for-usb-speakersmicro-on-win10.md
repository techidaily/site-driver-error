 If you fail to find the Hardware and Devices Troubleshooter in the Control Panel, that’s probably because your computer version is after **Windows 10 build 1809** .

1. Right-click on the**Start** button, then click**Windows PowerShell (Admin)** .

### Fix 4: Update your audio driver

 An old, corrupted, or missing audio driver can also cause your USB headset not to work. You can update your driver to solve this problem.```` ``

 You can download the latest driver from your computer manufacturer’s website. If you’re not confident or don’t have enough time and patience, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .```` ``

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

1. [Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)   and install Driver Easy. Then run it on your Windows.
2. Click **Scan Now** . It will quickly detect all driver problems of your computer. Your printer driver is no exception.
