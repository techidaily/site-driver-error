 If you’re trying to connect a portable device with your Windows, like iPhone, Android device, but it fails. And you see this error saying **Windows could not find driver software for your device** , you’re not alone. Many Windows users are reporting it. But the good news is you can fix it easily by yourself.

 Here’re 2 solutions you can try to fix this problem. Choose the one you prefer and try the other one if the previous one doesn’t work.

 **Solution 1:[Download the driver from your device manufacturer’s website manually](https://mindmanager.sjv.io/anq2nj)**
 **Solution 2:[Automatically install a latest driver for your device](https://review-au.sjv.io/wqnrq3)**

## Solution 1: Download the driver from your device manufacturer’s website manually

 To solve this problem, you can choose to download the driver manually. Go to the official website of your device, then download its driver and install it on your computer.

Or you can find the correct driver with your device’s ID.

 1) On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** **![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/img_59a516b53b983.png) and R**  at the same time to invoke the Run box.

 2) Type **devmgmt.msc**  and click **OK** .

 3) Right-click on your device in **Other device**  section and choose**Properties** . (Note: Due to this error, Windows cannot recognize your device, so it’s probably in Other device section.)

 4) Select **Hardware Ids**  in **Details**  section. Then **Copy**  the ID.

 6) Install the downloaded driver on your computer and check to see if your device is installed on your Windows successfully.

 If you’re not confident playing around with drivers or you don’t have enough time, patience, you can do it automatically through Solution 2:

## Solution 2: Automatically install a latest driver for your device

 You can download and install your device drivers automatically with  **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** .  It will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**   and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click **Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.
