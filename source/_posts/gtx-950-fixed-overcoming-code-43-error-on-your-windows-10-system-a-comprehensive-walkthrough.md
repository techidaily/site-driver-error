## GTX 950 [Fixed] – Overcoming Code 43 Error on Your Windows 10 System: A Comprehensive Walkthrough

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/img_59410acca7efb.jpg)

 Users with NVIDIA GTX 950 graphics card installed on their computer reported to have found that they see a yellow exclamation mark next to their display driver. when checking the properties of the video card driver, the following error notification appears:

 **Windows has stopped this device because it has reported problems. (Code 43)**

 The combination of GTX 950 and Windows 10 is not uncommon when it comes to Code 43 with NVIDIA. But no need to worry so much about it, there are ways to get it fixed.

[**Option 1: Clean re-install NVIDIA 950**](https://engwe.pxf.io/jrkzrn)

[**Option 2: Update Windows 10**](https://imp.i110150.net/r5bmpn)

[**Option 3: Update BIOS**](https://uperfect.sjv.io/g1jgba)

[**Option 4: Reinstall Windows 10**](https://ancheer.sjv.io/y96bgp)

 Before we move on to the fixes, there are something that you need to know about the causes of Code 43:

**a** . it could be that Windows does not recognize your graphics card. So you need to make sure that your graphics card is correctly installed;

**b** . code 43, in most cases, means that certain device driver is missing, corrupted, and/or outdated;

**c** . Windows cannot recognize faulty hardware either, so please make sure that your display card is in good conditions.

## Option 1: Clean re-install NVIDIA 950

 To perform a clean re-install of your graphics card driver, you may need some help from tools like CCleaner or Display Driver Uninstaller. In this post, we choose**Display Driver Uninstaller** .

 1) First, you need to download [**Display Driver Uninstaller**](http://download-eu2.guru3d.com/ddu/[Guru3D.com]-DDU.zip) . After the download, extract the setup file from the downloaded folder. Then double click the**Display Driver Uninstaller** file to get started.

 2) Make sure that you have saved all your files and folders. Choose from the drop-down menu**Safe Mode (Recommended)** . Then hit the**Launch** button.

 This allows you to go to Safe Mode and then DDU will clean uninstall your graphics card driver for you.

 3) In the safe mode, click the**Clean and restart (Highly recommended)** button so DDU will start with the uninstall.

 4) Wait for the process to finish, and your PC will restart in normal mode.

 5) Then go to NVIDIA drivers download website and search for GTX 950 driver for your device. After filling in the blanks, hit the**SEARCH** button to continue.

 Then follow the on-screen instructions to get the driver downloaded.

 When the download finish, just double click the setup file to run the driver installation.

 6) If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can do it automatically with [**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

## **Option 3: Update BIOS**

 Updating BIOS is said to solve the problem for many, but it requires you to master a rather high level of computer knowledge to update BIOS by yourself.

 So if you are not exactly a tech savvy, we suggested that you go to the manufacturer support website and get all the support available before you move on to update your BIOS.

**Warning** : Please do make sure that you are fully aware of what you are to do before you choose to update your BIOS. Unrecoverable errors are the last thing we want to see.

 After you make the decision of updating your BIOS, go to the manufacturer website of your PC and see if the latest version of BIOS is available to download. Then follow the instructions to get your BIOS updated.
