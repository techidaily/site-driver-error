 If you’re trying to connect a portable device with your Windows, like iPhone, Android device, but it fails. And you see this error saying **Windows could not find driver software for your device** , you’re not alone. Many Windows users are reporting it. But the good news is you can fix it easily by yourself.

 Here’re 2 solutions you can try to fix this problem. Choose the one you prefer and try the other one if the previous one doesn’t work.

 **Solution 1:[Download the driver from your device manufacturer’s website manually](https://mindmanager.sjv.io/anq2nj)**
 **Solution 2:[Automatically install a latest driver for your device](https://review-au.sjv.io/wqnrq3)**

## Solution 1: Download the driver from your device manufacturer’s website manually

 To solve this problem, you can choose to download the driver manually. Go to the official website of your device, then download its driver and install it on your computer.

Or you can find the correct driver with your device’s ID.

 1) On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** **![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/img_59a516b53b983.png) and R**  at the same time to invoke the Run box.

 2) Type **devmgmt.msc**  and click **OK** .

 3) Right-click on your device in **Other device**  section and choose**Properties** . (Note: Due to this error, Windows cannot recognize your device, so it’s probably in Other device section.)
