## Windows 10 Missing Coprocessor Driver Solution - What You Need to Know

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/img_5a72e511cadc0.jpg)

 After you upgraded your system to Windows 10 from Windows 7 or Windows 8, you might find your computer run slowly. Then you checked for the driver status in Device Manager, and saw a device named**Coprocessor** **with a yellow exclamation mark** next to it. You have no idea what the device is and how to remove the yellow mark. Don‚Äôt worry. You can fix this driver issue with the methods in this post.

 The Coprocessor with a yellow mark in Device Manager**means there is problem with chipset driver** , mostly Nvidia nForce chipset driver. To fix the problem, you just need to update the chipset driver.

 There are two simple methods to update the chipset driver. You can try both of them until you resolve the problem.

1. **[Update the driver manually via Device Manager](https://collovinc.sjv.io/jrkzwp)**
2. **[Update the driver automatically using Driver Easy](https://copa.sjv.io/6eoowq)**

## Method 1: Update the driver manually via Device Manager

 When you have driver problems like chipset driver issues, you can update the driver from Windows easily. You can update the driver via Windows Update or Device Manager. Then you don‚Äôt need to go to manufacturer‚Äôs website to check for the latest driver. Since you know how to open Device Manager, you can update the driver via Device Manager.

 It‚Äôs possible that Windows doesn‚Äôt provide the latest driver. If you‚Äôve tried this method but it doesn‚Äôt work for you, try Method 2.

 To update the Coprocessor driver in Device Manager, you just need to follow steps below (Following screen shots are just for your reference.):

 1) Open**Device Manager** .

 2) Double click **Coprocessor** to open the driver Properties window.

 3) Go to**Driver** tab and click**Update Driver** .

 4) Click**Search automatically for updated driver software** .
