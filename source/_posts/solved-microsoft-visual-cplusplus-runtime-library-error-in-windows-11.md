![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/microsoft-visual-c-runtime-error.jpg)

 If you recently upgraded to Windows 10 Technical Preview version, you may have seen the notification as follows:
  
“   **This application has requested the Runtime to terminate it in an unusual way. Please contact the application support team for more information.** ”
