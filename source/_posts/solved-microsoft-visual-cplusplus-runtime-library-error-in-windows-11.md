## Solved: Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime Library Error in Windows 11

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/microsoft-visual-c-runtime-error.jpg)

 If you recently upgraded to Windows 10 Technical Preview version, you may have seen the notification as follows:
  
“   **This application has requested the Runtime to terminate it in an unusual way. Please contact the application support team for more information.** ”
  
 The notification could be different due to different devices you are having problem with. In most of the cases, it has to do with your display or graphic card driver conflicting with your operating system.

 No need to worry too much about it, since we have fixes to help you with it. So, read along and find the fix for you.
