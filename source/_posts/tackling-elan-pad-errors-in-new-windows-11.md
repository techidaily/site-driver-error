## Tackling Elan Pad Errors in New Windows 11

 If you’re on Windows 10, and you find that your Elan touchpad suddenly stops working, you’re not alone. Many Windows 10 users are reporting this problem as well. But no worries, it’s possible to fix.

 Here are 3 fixes for you to try. You may not have to try them all; just work your way down until you find the one that works for you.

[**1: Enable your touchpad**](https://review-au.sjv.io/wqnrq3)
[**2: Reinstall your drivers**](https://getlyla.pxf.io/ek9gkg)
[**3: Stop automatic updates from Windows Update**](https://tinyland.pxf.io/org4ra)

## 1: Make sure your touchpad is enabled

 Some changes to your PC might automatically change your touchpad status to disable without informing you. You can set it back to enable status:

 1) On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**I** at the same time. Click **Devices** .

 You should also check if there is a function key that enables or disables your touchpad. On some laptops, this key is**F6** , or the combination of**Fn+F5** , or**Fn+F6** . You should check your PC manual to see which key or keys could be at fault.

## 2: Reinstall your drivers

 Faulty drivers provided by Microsoft could be the reason why your touchpad stops working properly. To tackle this problem, you should reinstall the driver.

 You need to uninstall the driver you are having now from Device Manager. Then download from the manufacturer support website the correct Elan touchpad driver for Windows 10 and install it.

 If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update your touchpad driver manually, you can do it automatically with [**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

**Driver Easy** will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the_FREE_ or the_Pro_ version of Driver Easy. But with the [**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) , it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money-back guarantee):

 1)[**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click**the Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

 3) Click the**Update** button next to an ELAN touchpad driver to automatically download and install the correct version of this driver (you can do this with the FREE version). Or click_**Update All**_ to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the [**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** ).
