 If you’re having the **Base System Device** driver problem, don’t worry. You can update the driver with one of the methods below. We’ve included three methods you can use to update the driver. Just choose an easier method to update your **Base System Device** driver.

1. [**Update the driver via Device Manager**](https://dhgate.sjv.io/5g6yb2)
2. [**Download and update the driver manually**](https://aofit.pxf.io/mmjyxq)
3. [**Update the drivers automatically**](https://modlily.sjv.io/aw92wr)

**TIP** : If you see more than one Base System Device listed in Device Manager, use one of the methods above to update the driver for each item.

## **Method 1: Update the Base System Device driver via Device Manager**

You can update the drivers through manager. Follow these steps:

 1) In Device Manager, right-click the device and click **Update Driver Software…** .

 3) Reboot your computer and check to see if the Base System Device driver issue is fixed.

 Windows may not provide the latest driver for the device. If this way doesn’t work for you, you can use [Method 2](https://zebaoaffiliateprogram.pxf.io/xkwqe1) or [Method 3](https://printrendy.pxf.io/xyboy5) .

## **Method 2: Update the Base System Device driver manually**

 Usually, you can go to the device manufacturer’s website or the PC manufacturer’s website to download the latest driver. But for Base System Device, it is impossible to know what the specific device is. The good news is you can get its device name and its vendor name to determine what it is.

 Follow steps below to get the device name and its vendor name.

 1) In Device Manager, right-click the device and click**Properties** .

 3) Click the **Details** tab, then select**Hardware Ids** from the drop-down menu of**Property** .

 4) The Hardware Id Value should be like follows. The VEN code means vendor and the DEV code means device. (In the example below, the VEN code is 15AD and the device is 0740.)
