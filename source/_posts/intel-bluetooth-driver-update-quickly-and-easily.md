[Way 1: Update the Driver via Device Manager](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)   
[Way 2: Download and Install the Driver from Manufacturers](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)   
[Way 3: Update the Driver Automatically](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)   
  
 **Way 1: Update the Driver via Device Manager**

**Note** if the driver is having problem, the device may be not recognized by Windows. In this case, check if there is Unknown Device listed under “Other devices”, which could be the bluetooth device.  
  
 3\. Select search automatically for updated driver software. Then Windows will search and install the new driver automatically.
