## **2: Update Xbox controller driver automatically (Recommended)**

 Windows only provide driver for Xbox 360 on builds earlier than Windows 7\. So if you are using Windows 10 (which is what most of you are using now), Windows 8.1 or 8, you will find the driver provided by Windows not helpful enough.

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the Xbox 360 driver manually, you can do it automatically with [**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks:

 1)[**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.
