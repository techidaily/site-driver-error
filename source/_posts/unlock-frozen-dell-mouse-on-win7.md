## Unlock Frozen Dell Mouse on Win7

 If the touchpad of your Dell laptop does not work correctly due to faulty drivers, updating drivers can fix the problem. Driver status can be checked in [Device Manager](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . There are 3 ways you can use to update the driver in Windows 7\. Note it is very important to download and install the right driver, as faulty driver may cause problems.

[Way 1: Update the driver through Device Manager](https://aidotcom.pxf.io/nkz4kv)
[Way 2: Download and install the driver from Dell](https://bluettide.pxf.io/ekmjb2)
[Way 3(Recommended): Update the driver using Driver Easy](#Way3)

 **Way 1: Update the driver through Device Manager**

Follow these steps:

 1\. Open [Device Manager](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

 2\. Expand categories and locate the touchpad device. Usually, the device is listed under category “Mice and other pointing devices”. If the device is not recognized by PC, you may find it under category “Other devices”.

If Windows fails to update the driver, proceed to other 2 ways.

 **Way 2: Download and install the driver from Dell**

 Before you get started, ensure that you know the laptop model and the specific system that you are using (Windows 7 32-bit or Windows 7 64-bit).

 1\. Open your favourite browser and type “PC model+driver download”. Let’s take Dell Vostro 3460 for example.

 3\. Click “Find it myself” and change OS to the one that your are using.

 If you can’t find Windows 7 driver on the website, download the driver for Vista, which is always compatible with Windows 7\.

 After download completes, you can install the driver by just double-clicking on the setup file (.exe file) and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

 **Way 3(Recommended): Update the driver using Driver Easy**
