## Solution 2: Update your USB driver

 If Solution 1 didn’t work for you, the most likely cause is a USB driver problem.

Fortunately, this is also one of the easiest problems to fix.

**Update your USB driver manually** — You can update your driver manually by going to the hardware manufacturer’s website, and searching for the latest driver for your USB drive. But if you take this approach, be sure to choose the driver that’s compatible with the exact model number of your hardware, and your version of Windows.

OR
