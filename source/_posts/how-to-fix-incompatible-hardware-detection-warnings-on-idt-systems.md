 When you‚Äôre installing IDT audio driver, if you can‚Äôt install the driver successfully and get error message: _**The hardware detected is not supported by this IDT software package**_  ._**The install will be aborted**_ . Don‚Äôt worry. You can install the driver successfully by following the steps below.  
  
 There are three methods you can use to install the IDT audio driver.  
  
1. **[Install the driver in Safe Mode](https://printrendy.pxf.io/xyboy5)**
2. **[Update the driver via Device Manager](https://modlily.sjv.io/aw92wr)**
3. **[Update the driver automatically](https://twopages.pxf.io/21em1d)**

**TIP** : If you know how to enter Safe Mode easily, you can still try to install the driver using the installer in Safe Mode. If not, it‚Äôs recommended you try Method 2 and Method 3 to update the driver.

##

 Method 1: Install the driver in Safe Mode

 Since you can‚Äôt install the driver in Normal Mode, try to install the driver in Safe Mode.  
  
 The way to enter Safe Mode is different depending on the operating system running on your computer. So go to the specific link below for the instructions to enter Safe Mode according to the operating system you‚Äôre using.  
  
 If you‚Äôre using Windows 10, go to [How to Enter Safe Mode in Windows 10](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .  
 If you‚Äôre using Windows 7, go to [How to Enter Safe Mode in Windows 7](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .  
 If you‚Äôre using Windows 8 & 8.1, go to [How to Enter Safe Mode in Windows 8 & 8.1](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .  
  
 If Method 1 doesn‚Äôt resolve the problem, move ahead to try other methods.

##

 Method 2: Update the driver via Device Manager

 This method works when you wish to update the driver. If you already tried this method, skip and try Method 3.  
  
 Follow steps below to update the IDT audio driver via Device Manager.  
  
 1\. On your keyboard, press**Win+R** (Windows logo key and R key) at the same time to invoke the run box.
