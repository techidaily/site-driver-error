## **Solution 2: Uninstall problem drivers to fix IRQL\_NOT\_LESS\_OR\_EQUAL**

 The problem can be caused by faulty drivers. To fix the problem, go to**Device Manager** and find the faulty drivers, then uninstall the drivers. If a driver is having problems, you’ll see a yellow mark next to its device (see the screenshot shown below).

<a href="https://electronicx.pxf.io/c/5597632/1872456/14483" target="_top" id="1872456"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14483-1872456" border="0" alt="" width="500" height="375"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1872456/14483" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->

Following steps are for your reference on how to uninstall a driver:

 1) Press  Win+R  (**Windows logo** key and**R** key) at the same time to invoke the run box.  
  
 2) Type **devmgmt.msc**  and click **OK** . Then Device Manager window will open.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/img_5a13fde1d72b1.png)

 3) In Device Manager, locate the faulty driver. If the driver is having problems, you’ll see a yellow mark next to the device name. Then right-click on the device name (For example, uninstall graphics card driver.) and select**Uninstall** .

 4) If prompted to confirm  the uninstall, check the box next to “Delete the driver software for this device.” then click the **OK**  button. If you don’t see this box, just click**OK** to uninstall the driver.  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/img_5a13feb35a43d.png)

 5) Restart your PC and check to see if the blue screen is gone  .  

## Solution 3 **: Perform a System Restore to fix IRQL\_NOT\_LESS\_OR\_EQUAL**

 The last solution that you can try is to do a system restore. If your System Protection is turned on, Windows will create a restore point before you install the driver. Then you can follow these steps to restore the driver to an earlier version to fix this issue.

 System Restore allows your system to go back to an earlier state. So some content of your system, like system settings, some programs, the registry, will be affected. But your personal files and data won’t be changed.

 1) Press**Win+R** (Windows logo key and R key) at the same time to invoke a run box.

 2) Type **rstrui.exe** and click**OK** . The System Restore Window will open.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/img_5a13ffd6b0139.png)

 3) Click Next then you may see the following screen. Select a restore point created before the error occurred. You can tell from the created**Date and Time** . Click **Next** to continue and follow the on-screen instructions to finish the restore.

4) Reboot your PC and check to see if the blue screen is gone.

## **Solution** 4: Reset or reinstall Windows
