## Other options

 There are some other alternatives that you can choose if the above methods cannot help you with your AMD Radeon R7 250 graphics card problem.

 1)**Update the BIOS** . You can go to the manufacturer website of you computer to see if you can see the updated version of your BIOS. If you can find it, download and install the BIOS updates and reboot your PC to see if the problem is gone. You should only do the changes when you are fully aware of what you are doing.

 2)**Refresh or reset Windows 10** . Reinstalling Windows 10 should be your last choice when you have already run out of other options. For more detailed information how to reinstall Windows 10, please visit the posts below:

 3)**Check AMD Radeon R7 250 hardware** . When you have ruled out the possible cause of the software, you should consider whether the problem is with the hardware. So you can  check the PCI-E slot or other related slots on the motherboard to see if the AMD graphics card is firmly slotted into the port. Cleaning up the dust in the port may also help.
