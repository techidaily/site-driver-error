## Optimal Camera Functionality: ASUS Webcam & Windows 10 Upgrade

 After you upgrade Windows 10 or update Windows 10, if the internal webcam isn’t recognized on your ASUS laptop, the cause most probably is the webcam driver. To fix the issue, you can reinstall the webcam driver or update the webcam driver.

 We’ve put two methods together to fix the error. You can try both of them until you fix your ASUS USB 2.0 webcam issue.

### Method 1: **Uninstall and reinstall the driver**

 In Device Manager, you may see a yellow mark next to USB2.0 webcam device. To fix the error, you can uninstall then reinstall the webcam driver.  
 Here’s what you need to do:

 1\. Open [Device Manager](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

 2\. Expand the category **Imaging Devices**  and right-click on the device. (In your case, the problematic device may be listed under**Other devices** . If you do not see the device under the category Imaging Devices**,** expand the category Other devices.)

 3\. Select**Uninstall** on the context menu.

 4\. When you’re prompted to confirm the uninstall, check the box next to “Delete the driver software for this device.”, then click the **OK** button.

 5\. Restart the computer, and check to see if the ASUS USB2.0 webcam issue is resolved.
