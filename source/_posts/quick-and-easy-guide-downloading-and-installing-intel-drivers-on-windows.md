## Quick & Easy Guide: Downloading & Installing Intel Drivers on Windows

With the latest network driver, you can access the Internet more smoothly and securely. There are two ways to update your Intel network driver. 

[**Option 1 — Manually**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) — You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your driver this way, because you need to find the exactly right driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

[**Option 2 — Automatically (Recommended)**](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/intel-network-drivers-download-and-install-for-windows-easily/#o2) — This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

##  Option 1 — Download and install the driver manually

 Intel keeps updating drivers. To get them, you need to go to the Intel website, find the driver corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 64 bit) and download the driver manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct driver for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

##  Option 2 — Automatically update your Intel network driver
