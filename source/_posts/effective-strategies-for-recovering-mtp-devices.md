## 2: Update the MTP USB Driver

 If no hardware device is at fault, it’s likely that you’re using the wrong driver altogether.

 There are two ways you can get the right drivers for your video card and monitor: manually or automatically.

**Manual driver update** – You can update your MTP USE driver manually by going to the manufacturer’s website, and searching for the most recent correct driver for it. Be sure to choose only driver that is compatible with your variant of Windows 10.

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your video and monitor drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with [**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)  .  Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your USB port, and your variant of Windows 10, and it will download and install them correctly :

 1)[**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.
