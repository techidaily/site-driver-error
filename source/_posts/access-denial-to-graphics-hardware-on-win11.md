 Hoorah! It’s finally time to play your favorite video game. You open your computer, try to start the program, and… uh oh… something went wrong. Instead of the game loading page, you get a scary error that says: **Application has been blocked from accessing Graphics hardware**  . Even though you haven’t made any changes to the game since the last time you played. So, what’s going on?

 First of all, don’t panic. It’s annoying… but you’re not the only one experiencing this problem. We’ve heard many reports of this error from Windows users. And luckily, it’s a problem you can easily fix by yourself.

## How do I Fix the Application that has been blocked from accessing Graphics hardware?

 This small guide covers 2 easy but effective ways to fix the problem.  If you try the first one and it doesn’t work for you, then you’ll hopefully have success with the second one.

1. [**Run System File Checker and DISM commands**](https://bluetties.sjv.io/lxv4pm)
2. [**Reinstall your display driver**](https://coinrule.sjv.io/rqzonv)

### Fix 2: Update your display driver

 This problem is**mostly caused by an out-of-date graphics card driver** , otherwise known as a **display driver** or **video driver** . You can fix it easily by updating your display driver.

 There’re **two**  ways you can update your display driver: manually and automatically.

**Manually —**  To update the display driver, you can choose to download the latest one from your display adapter manufacturer’s website, such as [Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/) , [AMD](http://support.amd.com/en-us/download) , [NVIDIA](http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx) **…**

**Automatically —** However, manual driver update is really time-consuming. If you are not tech savvy or, if you don’t have time and patience to do it manually, we highly recommend you update your display driver automatically using **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .  It’s a simple process. Here’s what you need to do:

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install to run Driver Easy.

 2) Click **Scan Now** . It will quickly detect all driver problems of your computer. This includes your display driver.
