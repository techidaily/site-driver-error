 In Device Manager, if you see a yellow mark next to “Broadcom USH” or “Broadcom USH w/swipe sensor” (Broadcom USH means Broadcom Unified Security Hub.), don’t worry, because this driver problem can be fixed easily. To fix the problem, you just need to update the driver for the device. We’ve put together two options below to update the driver. You can pick the method which is easier for you.

**[Option 1: Download and install the driver manually](https://bluetties.sjv.io/lxv4pm)**
  
**[Option 2 : Update the driver automatically](https://turtlebeacheu.sjv.io/1r0r59)**
