Fortunately, this is one of the easiest problems to fix.

 There are two ways to update your USB Composite Device driver:**manually** and**automatically** .

**Note:** Some USB devices have to do with your wired mouse, keyboard etc, which means uninstalling those devices will make them not working, don’t worry, just temporarily. As long as Windows restarts, it will automatically install the drivers again.
6. Once you’ve uninstalled them all,**restart** your computer.  

 If your mouse or keyboard is not working for now, you may need to force shutdown: you can press the power button of your computer for a few seconds until it begins to shutdown. Then, press the power button again to start your computer.
7. When you’ve logged on to your Windows desktop, plug your USB composite device into your computer and test.
