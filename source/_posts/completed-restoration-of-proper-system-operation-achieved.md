## [COMPLETED] Restoration of Proper System Operation Achieved

 For many external devices, you don’t need to install the driver manually, because Windows will install the driver automatically as soon as the device is plugged into your computer. If you meet the issue “**Device driver software was not successfully installed** “, it means Windows fails to provide a generic driver for the device. In this case, you need to download and install the driver manually.

 You can go to the device manufacturer’s website to download the latest driver. Before you get started, please ensure that you know the make and model of the device, and the specific operating system that your PC is running. Drivers can always be downloaded in the Support section of the website.**Note** that if you can’t find the driver you need for the operating system, the device may not support the operating system.

 The downloaded driver can always be installed by just double-clicking on the executable file (.exe). If the driver can’t still be installed successfully, try to install the driver step by step.

## Fix 1: Use Device Manager to fix driver problem

 Step 1: On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo + R keys** simultaneously to open the Run dialog box. Type**devmgmt.msc** and hit Enter to open the Device Manager.

Step 2: Find the device from the device list and right-click on it.

 Select **Update Driver Software…**
 Since the device driver is not installed successfully, you should see a yellow exclamation mark next to the device.
