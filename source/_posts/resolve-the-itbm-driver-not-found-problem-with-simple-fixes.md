 We’ve put together**three** methods to fix the ITBM Driver Not Available error. You may not have to try them all; just work your way down until you find the one that works for you.

3. **[Uninstall the Intel Turbo Boost Max Technology software](https://electronicx.pxf.io/xkwqkk)**

### Method 1: Update the Intel Turbo Boost Max Technology 3.0 driver

### Method 2: Configure the BIOS settings

 If BIOS doesn’t recognize the Intel Turbo Boost Max Technology 3.0 driver in Device Manager, you may encounter the ITBM Driver Not Available error. If that’s the case, you can enable the Intel Turbo Boost Max Technology in BIOS.

 The keys used to enter BIOS depend on the motherboard you’re using. Configuring BIOS can be risky, as incorrect settings can cause serious system problems. If you have advanced computer skills, you may be able do this on your own. If not, it’s recommended you contact the motherboard vendor for assistance. Their support may help you to enter the BIOS and enable the Intel Turbo Boost Max Technology.
