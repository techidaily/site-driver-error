### **Option 1 â€“ Download and install the device driver  automatically (Recommended)**

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You donâ€™t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you donâ€™t need to be troubled by the wrong driver you would be downloading, and you donâ€™t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. Driver Easy handles it all.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either [**the FREE**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) or **[the Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks:

### **Option 2 â€“ Download and install the device driver  manually**

 To manually download & install the driver in question, firstly youâ€™ll have to go to   **the hardwareâ€™s official website** , search your model of you device and then download & install it all on your own. And unless you know the exact model type to search and the variant of your Windows Operating System, it can present certain levels of difficulty.

**Warning** : Downloading the wrong driver or installing it incorrectly can compromise our PCâ€™s stability and even cause the whole system to crash. So please proceed at your own peril.

So here we go:

1. Go to the manufacturerâ€™s official website.
2. Check out the **Support**   section for **driver downloads** , then type in **the model of the hardware piece**   you want a driver update with and search.
3. Among the driver releases, make sure to **ONLY**   choose drivers that are both most up-to-date and compatible with **your variant of Windows Operating System** .
4. Run the downloaded file to finish the install.
5. **Restart**   your computer and donâ€™t forget to c heck**Device Manager** and see if the **No drivers installed for this device** problem has been fixed.
