### Fix 1: Do not plug your USB headset while Windows 10 is booting

 Some conflicts could exist between your USB headset and other USB devices. To avoid this conflict, please be sure to plug your USB headset in after your computer gets into Windows 10.```` ``

 In this case, you can unplug your USB headset first, and reboot your Windows 10\. Then plug your USB headset when Windows 10 starts.```` ``

Check if your headset works properly now.

### Fix 2: Run the Hardware Devices troubleshooter

 The troubleshooter can find and automatically fix some problems with your computer.

1. Type **troubleshooting**  in the search box from the Start menu. Then click **Find and fix problems**  on the top.

After that, check if your headset works properly now.

 If you fail to find the Hardware and Devices Troubleshooter in the Control Panel, that’s probably because your computer version is after **Windows 10 build 1809** . The version has removed the Hardware and Devices Troubleshooter. Don’t worry, you can still run the Hardware and Devices Troubleshooter in this way:

1. Right-click on the**Start** button, then click**Windows PowerShell (Admin)** .

2. Copy and paste**msdt.exe -id DeviceDiagnostic** in the PowerShell, then press the**Enter** key.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2020-05-07_16-02-37.jpg)
3. You’ll see the**Hardware and Devices** window popping out. Click**Next** .

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to finish the process.
5. Relaunch your computer and check whether the issue is resolved or not.````

### Fix 3: Set your USB headset as default device

1. Right-click on**Speakers/Headphone** icon at the bottom right of your taskbar. Then click **Playback devices** .

```` ```` ```` Check if your headset works properly now.

### Fix 4: Update your audio driver

 An old, corrupted, or missing audio driver can also cause your USB headset not to work. You can update your driver to solve this problem.```` ``

 You can download the latest driver from your computer manufacturer’s website. If you’re not confident or don’t have enough time and patience, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .```` ``

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

1. [Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)   and install Driver Easy. Then run it on your Windows.
2. Click **Scan Now** . It will quickly detect all driver problems of your computer. Your printer driver is no exception.

3. Click **Update All**  to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the [**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).  
 Note: You can also do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.
