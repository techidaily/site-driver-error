### Fix 2 – Clean install of the driver

 If you’re using the GeForce Experience app to update your graphics driver but it’s not installing or working as intended, consider downloading the driver itself from the official NVIDIA website and performing a clean installation. Before getting started, make sure you stop all the NVIDIA-related programs or files. Here’s how:

#### End NVIDIA processes

1. Right-click any empty space on your taskbar and click**Task Manager** .

#### Delete extra files

2. Navigate to the following folders and delete the files.  
_C:\\Program Files\\NVIDIA Corporation_

 _C:\\Windows\\System32\\DriverStore\\FileRepository\\nv\_lh document_  
 _C:\\Windows\\System32\\DriverStore\\FileRepository\\nvoclock document_  
 _C:\\Windows\\System32\\DriverStore\\FileRepository\\nvdsp.inf document_

#### Clean install the NVIDIA driver

1. Go to the [**NVIDIA driver download page**](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx) .
2. Choose the**Product Type** ,**Product Series** and**Product** appropriately, and then click**SEARCH** .

### Fix 3 – Temporarily disable antivirus

 The program you’re running in the background, whether it’s a GPU monitoring utility or antivirus software, might conflict with your NVIDIA driver installer and prevent it from launching. To see if that’s the case, you can**temporarily disable those background programs** and install the NVIDIA driver again. If the installation goes smoothly, then congrats! If the issue persists, don’t frustrate. There is one more fix to try.
