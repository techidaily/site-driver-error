### Fix 2 – Clean install of the driver

 If you’re using the GeForce Experience app to update your graphics driver but it’s not installing or working as intended, consider downloading the driver itself from the official NVIDIA website and performing a clean installation. Before getting started, make sure you stop all the NVIDIA-related programs or files. Here’s how:

#### End NVIDIA processes

1. Right-click any empty space on your taskbar and click**Task Manager** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/ta-1.jpg)
2. Select processes that are associated with NVIDIA, which should have NVIDIA in the name, and click**End Task** one by one.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/end-nvidia-process.jpg)

#### Delete extra files

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to invoke the File Explorer.
2. Navigate to the following folders and delete the files.  
_C:\\Program Files\\NVIDIA Corporation_  
 _C:\\Program Files (x86)\\NVIDIA Corporation_  
 _C:\\Windows\\System32\\DriverStore\\FileRepository\\nv\_lh document_  
 _C:\\Windows\\System32\\DriverStore\\FileRepository\\nvoclock document_  
 _C:\\Windows\\System32\\DriverStore\\FileRepository\\nvdsp.inf document_

#### Clean install the NVIDIA driver

1. Go to the [**NVIDIA driver download page**](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx) .
2. Choose the**Product Type** ,**Product Series** and**Product** appropriately, and then click**SEARCH** .  
 To download the optimized driver for the latest games, choose **Game Ready Drivers** next to Download Type, or you can select **Studio Drivers** for the design purposes.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/gtx-driver-download-manually-1.jpg)
3. Check if the operating system is detected correctly. If yes, click**DOWNLOAD** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/gtx-driver-download-manually-2.jpg)
4. Once done, right-click the downloaded file and select**Run as administrator** . Then specify the folder that the driver installer is to be installed.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/clean-install-1.jpg)
5. Choose**NVIDIA Graphics Driver** and click**AGREE AND CONTINUE** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/clean-install-2.jpg)
6. Tick**Custom (Advanced)** and click**NEXT** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/clean-install-3-1.jpg)
7. Tick**Perform a clean installation** and click**NEXT** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/clean-install-4-1.jpg)

 After you finish installing, reboot the machine for the changes to take effect and test if your NVIDIA driver is back on track. If not, move on to the third fix.

### Fix 3 – Temporarily disable antivirus

 The program you’re running in the background, whether it’s a GPU monitoring utility or antivirus software, might conflict with your NVIDIA driver installer and prevent it from launching. To see if that’s the case, you can**temporarily disable those background programs** and install the NVIDIA driver again. If the installation goes smoothly, then congrats! If the issue persists, don’t frustrate. There is one more fix to try.

### Fix 4 – Repair system files

 If none of the methods helped, the problem is likely related to system issues. Missing or damaged system files can lead to different types of installation issues on your computer. To fix it and keep your PC at tip-top condition, you could perform a thorough scan and repair of your system.

**[Fortect](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  is a safe and professional repair solution with various functions. It can not only replace corrupted Windows files and components, but also detect security threats like viruses or malware while improving your device’s stability. And most importantly, it won’t harm your custom settings or personal data during the process.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Fortect.
2. Open Fortect and click**Yes** to run a free scan of your PC.
