### **Way 1: Start the HControl.exe** program

 Before you try this fix, make sure that you have installed the ATK package in your ASUS notebook. The ATK package, containing drivers that control your hotkeys, backlight and some other optional functionality, is usually pre-installed in every new ASUS laptop. And the HControl.exe program we need to start is also within this ATK package. In most cases you can navigate to HControl.exe through the following path:

 **C:\Program Files (x86)\ASUS\ATK Package\ATK Hotkey\Hcontrol.exe**

 Just copy this path and paste it to the address bar of your File Explorer. After finding**HControl.exe** , you should double-click on it to execute the program.

 Then, on your keyboard, press**Fn** and**F4** at the same time to test if the backlight of your keyboard can be turned on.

 If you cannot navigate to this program, then perhaps your ATK package is installed in another folder. In this case, you should search for “ATK Package” in File Explorer until you find Hcontrol.exe in a folder named ATK Hotkey.  
 There’s also a chance that your ATK package has not been pre-installed on the laptop. If so, move on to**[Way 2](https://bluetties.sjv.io/lxv4pm)** .

 If this fix doesn’t work for you, please proceed to the next fix below.

### **Way 2: Download and install the latest drivers**

 As reported by some users, they couldn’t turn on the keyboard backlight after updating their operating system. If that’s when you encounter the issue, you should download and install the latest drivers (including ATK Package drivers and Smart Gesture drivers) that control the backlight function of your notebook.

There are mainly two options for you to download and install the drivers.

**[Option 1 – Manually](https://printrendy.pxf.io/xyboy5)** – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right drivers online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

**[Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)](#option2)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

---

#### Option 1 – Update the drivers manually

 To update the drivers manually, you should perform the following procedure:

1. Find your way to the download center of ASUS, or you can simply click **[here](https://www.asus.com/support/Download-Center/)**  .
2. On the pop-up page, enter the model name of your laptop to search for its drivers. If you don’t know its exact model, then try to select a product from the given list. After that, hit**Enter** on your keyboard.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image-48.png)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
3. On the next page, select your Windows version. Then you’ll be greeted with a list of drivers and programs available for download.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2019-08-05_18-25-19.jpg)
4. Scroll through the list until you find the following two drivers:**Smart Gesture** driver and**ATK Package** driver. Then, click on the**DOWNLOAD** button next to each driver.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2019-08-05_18-31-49.jpg) ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2019-08-05_18-45-12.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
5. Wait till the download process is complete. The two downloaded files are compressed, so you need to extract them to a desired location.
6. Open the extracted folders of the two drivers. Find**Setup.exe** in their folders respectively and click on it. Then, follow the onscreen instructions to install the drivers.
7. When everything’s done, restart your computer for the changes to take effect. Then check to see if your keyboard backlight can be turned on properly (press**Fn+F4** on your keyboard to enable the backlight).

#### Option 2 – Automatically update the drivers

 Downloading and installing the drivers manually can be somewhat time-consuming and error-prone.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
3. Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All). Or if you just want to update the ATK Package driver for now, simply click the **Update**  button next to it. ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2019-08-05_19-15-46.jpg)
