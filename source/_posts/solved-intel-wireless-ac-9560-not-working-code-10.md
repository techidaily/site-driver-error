### Fix 2: Make sure Wi-Fi is turned on

 If you’re sure, or can’t determine your Wi-Fi is enabled, simply continue to the next fix below.

1. On your keyboard, press**Win+R** (the Windows logo key and the R key) to invoke the**Run** dialog. Then type or paste**devmgmt.msc** and click**OK** .

3. Restart your computer and repeat these steps to enable the AC-9560 adapter.

If this trick doesn’t give you luck, take a look at the next one.

### Fix 4:**Reinstal** l the AC-9560 driver

4. Now restart your computer.

#### Install the AC-9560 driver

 Windows 10 should install the generic network driver after a reboot. But that’s not always the case. If Windows failed, or you’re on Windows 7 or 8, you can use the following steps to install the latest network driver.

 There’re 2 ways you can do this. You can go to the [Intel driver download page](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/99446/intel-wireless-ac-9560.html) and search for your model, then download and install the driver manually. Or, if you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills, you can do all this automatically with [**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

 If your PC has no Internet, you can download Driver Easy from another computer, then install it on the offline PC. With the **[Offline Scan feature](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  of Driver Easy, you can download & install network drivers**even without Internet** .

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Scan-now-1.jpg)
3. Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.  
 (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/9560-de-update.jpg)

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with _full technical support_ . If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://bellelily.pxf.io/m5azgm) .**

 Once you’ve installed the latest AC-9560 driver, restart your PC for the changes to apply.

### Fix 5: Turn on WLAN AutoConfig service

 WLAN AutoConfig is a Windows service that controls how your Wi-Fi works. If this service is disable or is set incorrectly, your Wi-Fi won’t work. So you need to make sure it’s set to running automatically.

Here’s how you can check:

1. On your keyboard, press**Win+R** (the Windows logo key and the R key) to invoke the**Run** dialog. Then type or paste**services.msc** and click**OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/run-box-services-msc.jpg)
2. Find a service named**WLAN AutoConfig** . Right click and select**Properties** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/wlan-autoconfig-properties-1.jpg)
3. Make sure**Startup type** is set to**Automatic** . And**Service status** is**Running** .
