### Method 1: Update the Intel Turbo Boost Max Technology 3.0 driver

 The problem is probably caused by the missing Intel Turbo Boost Max Technology 3.0 driver. To fix the problem, you can try to update the device driver.

 You can go to [Intel Download Center](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/) to download the latest Intel Turbo Boost Max Technology 3.0 driver manually.

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**   and install Driver Easy.

### Method 2: Configure the BIOS settings

 The keys used to enter BIOS depend on the motherboard you’re using. Configuring BIOS can be risky, as incorrect settings can cause serious system problems. If you have advanced computer skills, you may be able do this on your own. If not, it’s recommended you contact the motherboard vendor for assistance. Their support may help you to enter the BIOS and enable the Intel Turbo Boost Max Technology.

### Method 3: Uninstall the Intel Turbo Boost Max Technology software
