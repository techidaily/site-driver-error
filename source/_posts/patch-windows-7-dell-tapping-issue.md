## Patch Windows 7 Dell Tapping Issue

 If the touchpad of your Dell laptop does not work correctly due to faulty drivers, updating drivers can fix the problem.

If Windows fails to update the driver, proceed to other 2 ways.

 **Way 2: Download and install the driver from Dell**

 Before you get started, ensure that you know the laptop model and the specific system that you are using (Windows 7 32-bit or Windows 7 64-bit).

 1\. Open your favourite browser and type “PC model+driver download”. Let’s take Dell Vostro 3460 for example.
