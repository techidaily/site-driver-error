### Fix 1: Restart your computer

 Sometimes, a simple reboot can fix the issue. This is the first thing you should try when the Enter key is not working.

 If you’re using a laptop, you can try removing the battery and keeping the power button pressed for 30 seconds or more. After that, install the battery and turn on your laptop to see if the Enter key works now.

 Luckily, it will resolve your problem all at once, and you don’t need to worry about it anymore. If the Enter key is still not working, you should try Fix 2 below.

### Fix 2: Adjust your keyboard settings

 The Sticky Keys, Toggle Keys, and Filter Keys enable your keyboard easier to type. However, sometimes they cause problems, and the Enter key not working is one of them. To fix it, you need to turn off these features.

Here is how to do it:

#### on Windows 10

 1) Type**Ease of Access** in the Search box, then select**Ease of Access keyboard settings** .

 3) After uninstalling, restart your computer to let Windows reinstall the keyboard driver automatically.

 4) Check if the Enter key is working.

 Your Enter key should be working perfectly again now. If not, you can try the next fix below.

### Fix 4: Update the keyboard driver

 If reinstalling the keyboard driver doesn’t work, you should update your keyboard driver to see if it fixes your problem. There are two ways you can update your keyboard driver:

#### Option 1:**Manually**

 You can go to the manufacturer’s website of your keyboard, find exactly the right driver, download it, and install it step by step.

#### Option 2:**Automatically (Recommended)**

 If you don’t have the time, patience, or skills to update the driver manually, you can**do it automatically** with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the**FREE** or the**Pro** version of Driver Easy. But with the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) ,** it takes just 2 steps (and you get full support and it comes with a 30-day money-back**guarantee**):

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

 3) Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro Version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).
