## Solution 3 **: Perform a System Restore to fix IRQL\_NOT\_LESS\_OR\_EQUAL**

 The last solution that you can try is to do a system restore. If your System Protection is turned on, Windows will create a restore point before you install the driver. Then you can follow these steps to restore the driver to an earlier version to fix this issue.

 System Restore allows your system to go back to an earlier state. So some content of your system, like system settings, some programs, the registry, will be affected. But your personal files and data won’t be changed.

 1) Press**Win+R** (Windows logo key and R key) at the same time to invoke a run box.

 2) Type **rstrui.exe** and click**OK** . The System Restore Window will open.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/img_5a13ffd6b0139.png)

 3) Click Next then you may see the following screen. Select a restore point created before the error occurred. You can tell from the created**Date and Time** . Click **Next** to continue and follow the on-screen instructions to finish the restore.
