### Fix 1: Download another version of Corsair Link

 Some certain versions of Corsair Link may be related to the occurrence of this issue, so you should uninstall whatever version you’re using right now and reinstall a new one that works properly. Even if you haven’t installed Corsair Link on your computer before, you can still expect this fix to do the trick. Just try it!

 1) On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo** key and**I** at the same time to open the Settings window. Then click**Devices** .

 2) In the next window, select your Corsair device (the one that’s causing your Corsair USBXp Driver issue) and click**Remove device** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-21.png)

 This screenshot is just an example for better explanation. Pick your Corsair device and remove it.

 3) On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo** key and**R** at the same time to invoke the Run dialog box. Type in**appwiz.cpl** and click**OK** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-22.png)

 4) In the pop-up window, scroll through the list until you find the Corsair Link app (you may skip this step if you have no Corsair Link). Right-click on it and click**Uninstall** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-27.png)

 5) After you’ve removed the Corsair device and uninstalled Corsair Link, it’s time to reinstall another version of the app. Visit **[this website](https://www.corsair.com/us/en/downloads#download%5Fform%5F71)**  , download Corsair Link, and install it on your PC all over again.

 An early version released in 2017, which is**4.7.0.77** , should be applicable to fix the problem. Since it’s a bit old, you can try downloading the latest version of Corsair Link (4.9.9.3). If it doesn’t work, then take a stab at 4.7.0.77.

 6) When you’re all set, launch Corsair Link and see if the app can recognize your Corsair device.

 Then open Device Manager and check whether the Corsair USBXp Driver item is still there. If it is, move on to the next fix.

### Fix 3: Update your Corsair device driver

 Sometimes your Corsair USBXp Driver issue is caused by an outdated driver. To update the driver, you have two options:

**[Option 1 – Update the driver via Device Manager](https://uperfect.sjv.io/g1jgba)**  – This is the most common method to update your driver, but sometimes Windows may fail to provide you with the latest (and even necessary) device drivers.

OR

**[Option 2 – Update the driver automatically (Recommended)](#option2)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

#### Option 1 – Update the driver via Device Manager

Here’s how:

 1) On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo** key and**R** at the same time to invoke the Run dialog box. Type in**devmgmt.msc** and click**OK** .

 2) In the Device Manager window, expand**Universal Serial Bus controllers** to find the**Corsair USBXp Driver** item.

 5) Wait for the searching process to be complete. If there’s indeed a pending update, you should follow the onscreen instructions to install it. However, if Windows informs you that your driver is up to date (which may not be true), you should give**Option 2** a whirl.

#### Option 2 – Update the driver automatically (Recommended)

### **Fix 4: Check your fan connectors**

 According to some users of Corsair cooling fans, they got the issue because their fan connectors have gone loose. This can be easily fixed by pushing the connectors back in and reconnecting the fans. If you’re not sure whether the connection of your Corsair fans is all right, you should check.
