## What is WPD FileSystem Volume Driver?

 WPD FileSystem Volume Driver is not the driver for a particular device. Instead, WPD stands for “Windows Portable Device” which covers a wide range of devices such as mobile phones, digital cameras, etc. Since the driver often appears with a yellow exclamation mark, it is in fact an error sign notifying you of certain problems with your device. When you notice this entry listed below the “Portable Devices” node, there’s huge likelihood that the portable device you’ve just connected to the PC is not working properly, or not recognized by the computer. Whatever problem you’re faced with, please rest assured that you’re not alone. Usually it’s not very hard to resolve.
