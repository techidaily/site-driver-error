### Fix 3 – Temporarily disable antivirus

 The program you’re running in the background, whether it’s a GPU monitoring utility or antivirus software, might conflict with your NVIDIA driver installer and prevent it from launching. To see if that’s the case, you can**temporarily disable those background programs** and install the NVIDIA driver again. If the installation goes smoothly, then congrats! If the issue persists, don’t frustrate. There is one more fix to try.
