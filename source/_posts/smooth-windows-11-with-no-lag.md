 If the above methods don’t work, go check your**Task Manager** for clues on which applications could be at fault. If they’re occupying a lot of disk usage, it’s worth looking into. When you locate any suspicious applications, right-click them and click End Task to see if the mouse lagging problem is resolved.

## **Other options**
