 6) Install the downloaded driver on your computer and check to see if your device is installed on your Windows successfully.

 If you’re not confident playing around with drivers or you don’t have enough time, patience, you can do it automatically through Solution 2:

## Solution 2: Automatically install a latest driver for your device

 You can download and install your device drivers automatically with  **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** .  It will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**   and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click **Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3) Click **Update**  next to your flagged device driver to automatically download and install the correct version of this driver (you can do this with the FREE version).

Or click **Update All**  to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_  the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the Pro version – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).
