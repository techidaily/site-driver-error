## Fix HP Photosmart Printer Driver Issues for Windows 10

 After you upgrade the system to Windows 10 or perform a Windows 10 update, if your HP Photosmart printer doesn’t work as usual, it most properly has driver issues. In this case, you need to fix the driver issues by updating the drivers.

  New system always has driver compatibility issues, especially for Windows 10\. For many manufacturers, they have not released Windows 10 drivers. So HP may not release Windows 10 drivers for your printer model.  

 HP has declared that most HP printers in use with Windows 7 or Windows 8 will continue to work smoothly without the need to reinstall drivers. If you upgrade from Windows 7 or Windows 8, your HP Photosmart printer should have worked with no problems. Or you may need to install the latest Windows 10 driver.  

 You can visit the [HP website](http://support.hp.com/sg-en/document/c04658195#Install%5Fdriver%5Ffrom%5FHP%5Fwebsite) to check whether your printer model supports Windows 10.  

 There are three methods below you can use to update the drivers. They are two traditional methods and one more effective method.

 **Method 1:**

**Download the driver from HP**

  Go to [HP Customer Support – Software and Driver Downloads](http://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers) . Then enter your HP model number to find your product. After that, you will be directed to the download page. You can find the right drivers there. If you can find Windows 10 driver, your printer definitely supports Windows 10\. (example: C4580).  Usually, you just need to double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver. If there is no Windows 10 driver, try the additional drivers.

  1\. Enter your HP Photosmart Printer model then click on **Find my product button.**

  You need to update drivers manually by using Method 1 and Method 2\. And it may take you a lot of time to find drivers and install the drivers. Following you will learn the most effective update method.

 **Method 3:**
