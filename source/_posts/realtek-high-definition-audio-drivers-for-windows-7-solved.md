 If you’re having problems with the**Realtek High Definition Audio driver on Windows 7** , you can’t hear the sound. But don’t worry. You can fix the Windows 7 audio driver problem easily with the tips below.

 To fix the problem, you can just update the audio driver. There are two ways you can update your audio drivers:

[**Option 1 – Manually**](https://laganoo.pxf.io/5g6ygn) – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right the driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

**[Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)](#option2)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

### **Option 1 –**  **Download and install the driver manually**

 To get the latest Reatek audio driver for your Windows 7, you need to go to the [Realtek](https://www.realtek.com/en/downloads) [](https://www.realtek.com/en/downloads)  website, find the drivers corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows 7 (32 or 64 bit) and download the driver manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct drivers for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

### **Option 2 –  Automatically update Realtek audio drivers**

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the Realtek driver manually, you can do it automatically with Driver Easy.
