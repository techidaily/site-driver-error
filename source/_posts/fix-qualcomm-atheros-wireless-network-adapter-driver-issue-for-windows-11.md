 If you can’t update the driver successfully using Method 1, move on and try other methods.

###

**Way 2: Download and install the driver from manufacturer**

 Since Atheros doesn’t produce drivers themselves, you can go to your PC manufacturer’s website to check for and download the latest driver. Before you get started, ensure that you know the PC model and the specific operating system that you are using (Windows 10 32-bit or Windows 10 64-bit). Usually, the downloaded driver will be in executable format (.exe). You can install the driver by just double-clicking on the executable file and follow the on-screen instructions.  
  
 If your PC can’t be connected to internet, download the driver using another PC with internet access. Then use USB flash drive to transfer the driver to your PC.  

###

**Way 3: Update the driver using Driver Easy**
