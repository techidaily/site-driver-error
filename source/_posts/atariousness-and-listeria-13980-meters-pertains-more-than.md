**Method Three: A Work-around**
  
This method is reported useful according to some users, so we include it here for you to have a try.
  
If you leave your laptop on all the time and only close the laptop lid instead of turn the laptop off completely, you might want to check this method out. Your laptop seems to remain in a sleep state after you have opened the lid. To fix the problem, you need press the**Windows key**to invoke the**Start**panel, then use the**left arrow key**to navigate to the**Shut Down, Hibernate, Log Out, Lock** and**Sleep**functions. Choose Sleep and let your laptop go to sleep. Once it is in a sleep state, hit the**Esc**key and it will wake up with the touchpad mouse function restored.
