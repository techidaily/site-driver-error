 If Windows fails to provide the new drivers, you can download the driver manually. Downloading drivers manually can’t be easy and can take you a lot of time. So instead of downloading drivers manually, you can use Driver Easy to download drivers automatically, which can scan your computer quickly to detect problem drivers and give you a list of new drivers. Click [here](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) to download Driver Easy now.

**Solution 3: Editing the Relative Registry**
  
 Note modifying registry entries might cause serious system problems, especially if it is done incorrectly. Before you get started, it is recommended that you back up the registry. See [How to Back Up and Restore Registry](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .  
  
1\. Press **Win+R** (Windows logo key and R key) at the same time. A Run dialog will appear.

 5\. In the right pane, find**UpperFilters** . Right-click on it and click**Delete** .  
 6\. Unplug your iPhone and reboot the computer.  
 7\. After restarting, plug in your iPhone again.  
  
 If none of above solutions work for you, the cause might be USB port or the cable. Plug your iPhone to different USB port and see if it works. And use another cable to have a try. This may work like a charm.
