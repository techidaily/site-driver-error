### Mouse lagging, not moving?

1. **[Clean your mouse](https://technitya.sjv.io/dkpn02)**
2. **[Adjust Razer Synapse Settings](https://getlyla.pxf.io/ek9gkg)**

#### 1\. Clean your mouse

 If the cursor doesn’t move, it’s probably because your mouse’s sensor might be dirty.

 Clean the sensor using a Q-tip lightly coated in rubbing alcohol. Let the sensor dry for 5 minutes before trying the mouse again.

#### 2\. Adjust Razer Synapse Settings

 If you have installed Razer Synapse, adjusting a few Razer Synapse settings might fix random mouse freezes.

1) Open Razer Synapse.

2) Click the**Performance** tab, then adjust the**Polling Rate** set to**500** if required.

3) Click the**Calibration** tab, then select the**Surface Calibration** option if it’s not currently on.

5) If you don’t have a Razer mouse pad, select the**Others** option and your mouse pad. Follow the instructions to calibrate the mouse pad.
