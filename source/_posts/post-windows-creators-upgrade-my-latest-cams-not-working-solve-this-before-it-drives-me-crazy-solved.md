## Post-Windows Creators Upgrade, My Latest Camâ€™s Not Working: Solve This Before It Drives Me Crazy! ðŸ˜  [Solved]

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/img_58e8542d5f712.jpg) Microsoft has released Windows 10 Creators Update for early adapters who are willing to install it. We have talked about [**what new features will Microsoft bring us in the Creators Update**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/), which is the second biggest update of Windows 10\. But this update seems to have caused some problem for users with Logitech Brio Webcam. The latest update of Windows 10 seems to render the Logitech Brio webcam into not having video or not detected by the PC. Even though it is not a pleasant experience, this problem can be easily fixed by ourselves. 1) Press**Windows key**and**X**at the same time, then choose**Device Manager**. ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/img_58e85923107a1.png) 2) Select and expand category**Imaging devices**.
