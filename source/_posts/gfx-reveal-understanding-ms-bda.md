## GFX Reveal: Understanding MS BDA

 If you just updated to a new version or build of Windows 10 or reformatted your computer, and you find that your screen resolution is terrible, you’re not alone. Many Windows 10 users are reporting this problem. In fact, this is not a unique problem for Windows 10 users, it happened on Windows 8.1 and Windows 8 before.

 If you look deeper in **[Device Manager](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  , you will see that the item listed under the Display adapters category is Microsoft Basic Display Driver, as opposed to the name of your graphics card model.

 You may wonder, what happens to my graphics card, and why can’t I see it anymore. No worries, this problem is not at all hard to fix. And we’re here to help.

### Fix 3: Replace the graphics card

 If updating your graphics card driver doesn’t help to solve the problem, you may need to consider getting your graphics card replaced, as it might be faulty.

 Note that certain series of display card products are not certified to support Windows Display Driver Model 1.2 or higher, and therefore, do not have driver support for Windows 10\.

 Therefore, it is suggested that you change your current display driver to a more advanced one. You may need to consult professional advice on how to select a good graphics card for your computer.
