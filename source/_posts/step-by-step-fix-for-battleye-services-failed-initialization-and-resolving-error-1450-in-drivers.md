You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install them all automatically.

### Fix 4: Disable or uninstall antivirus

 It’s also possible that your antivirus is blocking BattlEye. You can**close** any antivirus on your computer and**run** your game**as administrator** and see if this solves your problem.

 If you run an application as administrator, you’re notifying your computer system that the application you’re going to run is safe and should be allowed with administrative privileges.

 To run your game as administrator, you can right-click on the executable (.exe) file of or the desktop shortcut to your game, and then select**Run as administrator** .
