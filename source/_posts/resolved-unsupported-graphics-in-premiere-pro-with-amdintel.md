## Resolved: Unsupported Graphics in Premiere Pro with AMD/Intel

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/2021-10-25_10-45-14.png)

 Getting the “Unsupported Video Driver” error when you’re launching Adobe Premiere Pro and the program just crashes at startup? This is a quite common error and also an easy one to fix. Read on and find out how to solve the problem right away.

## Why am I getting this error?

 The “Unsupported Video Driver” error message suggests that your current graphics driver is not compatible with Premiere Pro. An outdated or faulty video driver could cause this problem. Or, in some cases, Premiere Pro fails to recognize your driver which is actually functional and thus triggers the error.

## Try these fixes…

[1: Update your video driver](https://ukaidot.sjv.io/daqnoj)

## Fix 1: Update your video driver

 There are two ways to update your video driver: Automatically (recommended!) and manually.

### Automatic update

Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your exact graphics card and your Windows version, then it will download and install it correctly:

1. [Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/1-5.jpg)
3. Click the **Update**  button next to the flagged video driver to automatically download the correct version of the driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

### Manual update

 You can also update your graphics driver manually. The common way to update a driver on your PC is via the Device Manager (a Windows feature). But Windows may not detect the latest available update for your video card because the database is huge and the updates could be delayed.

 To fix the “Unsupported Video Driver” error in Premiere Pro, we recommend directly downloading the latest correct driver from the vendor site and installing it. You would also need to look up what video card you have if you don’t know. Here’s how:

1. Press the**Windows key** and**R** on your keyboard to invoke the Run box.
2. Type in**dxdiag** , then click**OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Run-dxdiag.jpg)
3. Click**Display** (I have two monitors so it’s shown as Display 1.) You’ll find your graphics card information here. Mark down the**name** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/2021-10-25_15-01-41.png)
4. Go to the official sites and search for your video driver. Make sure you download only the driver that’s compatible with your Windows version.  

[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)  
[INTEL](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics)  
[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)  
[Asus](https://www.asus.com/support/Download-Center/)
5. Install the driver.

 Sometimes Premiere Pro doesn’t support the latest drivers for some video cards and you may need to roll back your driver to the previous version. You can use Driver Easy Pro to [roll back your video driver easily.](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

 After you install the latest video driver, restart your PC and test if Premiere Pro still shows you the error message. If the problem persists, there’s one more fix you can try.

## Fix 2: Update Premiere Pro

 If your driver is up-to-date but you still get the “Unsupported Video Driver” error, you may need to update your Premiere Pro. New Adobe updates usually fix known bugs and may release new features that are compatible with the latest driver, so it may solve the “Unsupported Video Driver” error.

 If updating Premiere Pro doesn’t solve your problem and you wish to downgrade to the previous version, you can uninstall the current version first. Then, you should be able to find the previous installation pack in your local folder.
