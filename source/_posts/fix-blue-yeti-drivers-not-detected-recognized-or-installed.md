### Method 2: Update your device drivers

You can fix your driver issues by updating your device drivers.

 **You’t don need to find a proprietary driver for Blue Yeti.**
 Unless you’re using a_Blue Yeti Pro_ product, you can’t find any driver specially for your Yeti microphone. But that doesn’t mean updating your drivers is not a good fix. A corrupted or outdated USB or audio driver can cause your issue, so you should still make sure your device drivers are up to date.

 If you don’t have the time, patience or skills to update your driver manually, you can do it automatically with [**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

**Driver Easy**  will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can download and install your drivers by using either Free or **Pro**  version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes only **2**  clicks (and you get **full support** and a **30-day money back guarantee**):
