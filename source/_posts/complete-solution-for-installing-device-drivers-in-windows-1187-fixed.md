So here we go:

1. Go to the manufacturerâ€™s official website.
2. Check out the **Support**   section for **driver downloads** , then type in **the model of the hardware piece**   you want a driver update with and search.
3. Among the driver releases, make sure to **ONLY**   choose drivers that are both most up-to-date and compatible with **your variant of Windows Operating System** .
4. Run the downloaded file to finish the install.
5. **Restart**   your computer and donâ€™t forget to c heck**Device Manager** and see if the **No drivers installed for this device** problem has been fixed.
