### Fix 1: Disable SuperFetch

 SuperFetch helps to decrease boot time and make must-load programs more efficiently. However, it has been identified as a potential cause of disk performance issues in Windows 8 and later versions of Windows, including Windows 10\. Here’s how to stop this service:

 1) On your keyboard, press**Windows logo key** , type**command prompt** , then select**Run as administrator** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2020-10-19_11-01-38.jpg)

2) Click **Yes**  at the**User Account Control** prompt.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/img_594b3e672c3ff.jpg)

 3) The command prompt will once again display. Type in the following command:

net.exe stop superfetch

 4) Hit**Enter** on your keyboard.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/disable-superfetch-service.jpg)

 5) **If the command above isn’t valid, try the following one instead:**

 net.exe stop sysmain

 6) Wait for a few minutes to see if your computer starts performing better. Or check your computer’s disk usage: Type “task manager” in the Windows search bar and select**Task Manager** , then in the Processes tab, look at the % at the top of the Disk column. If it’s no longer 100%, you’ve fixed the problem!

### Fix 4: Perform a disk check

 1) On your keyboard, press**Windows key** and**X** at the same time, then choose**Command Prompt (Admin)** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/img_594b3dfa5842c.png)

2) Click **Yes**  at the**User Account Control** prompt.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/img_594b3e5e14b63.jpg)

 3) The command prompt will once again display. Type in the following command:

chkdsk.exe /f /r

 4) Hit**Enter** on your keyboard, then type**Y** to confirm that you’d like to perform the disk check the next time you restart your computer. Please make sure you have closed all of your applications first.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/img_594c79d06cf80.png)

**IMPORTANT:** Disk check will start the next time you boot your PC and it might take some time to complete (could be a day for some). If, when you restart, you don’t have time to wait for the disk check to complete, you can skip it. You’ll need to reschedule it again, as described above, though.

 5) Once you’ve completed the disk check, check your computer’s disk usage again: Type “task manager” in the Windows search bar and select**Task Manager** , then in the Processes tab, look at the % at the top of the Disk column. If it’s no longer 100%, you’ve fixed the problem!

![100% disk usage resolved](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/100-disk-usage-resolved.png)

If the 100% disk usage problem persists, try the next method, below.

### Fix 5: Reset Virtual Memory

 Virtual memory can be considered an extension of your computer’s physical memory. It’s a combination of RAM and a portion of your hard drive. When the RAM isn’t enough to perform a task, Windows will temporarily store files in virtual memory, then swap them back to RAM when required.

 To reset virtual memory:  

 1) On your keyboard, press**Windows key** and**Pause/ Break** key at the same time. Then choose **Advanced System Settings** on the left panel.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/2020-03-23_10-35-27.jpg)

 2) Go to the**Advanced** tab, then click **Settings** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/2020-03-23_10-36-39.jpg)

 3) Go to the **Advanced** tab again, and choose**Change…**  in the Virtual memory section.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/2020-03-23_10-39-13.jpg)

 4) Ensure the **Automatically manage paging file size for all drives** checkbox is**NOT** ticked.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/2020-03-23_10-37-37.jpg)

 5) Select your windows drive (the hard drive or partition that has Windows installed on it – usually **C:**)**,** and enter an Initial size and Maximum size for your virtual memory:

* **Initial size** – This value varies, depending on your computer. If you’re not sure what value to use, just enter whatever the number is in the**Recommended** category.
* **Maximum size** – Don’t set this value too high. It should be about 1.5 times the size of your physical RAM. e.g. A PC with 4 GB (4096 MB) of RAM should have no more than about 6,144 MB virtual memory (4096 MB x 1.5).

 Once you’ve entered your virtual memory values, click **Set** , then click **OK** to continue.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/2020-03-23_10-39-55.jpg)

 6) Clear all your computer’s ‘temp’ files. On your keyboard, press**Windows key** and**R** at the same time, then in the Run form, type**temp** and hit**Enter** . This will invoke Windows Explorer with your Temp folder open, showing you all the temp files on your computer.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/img_5940a4d089b3e.png)

7) Select all the files in the Temp folder and delete them.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/img_5940a52e5c1ac.jpg)

 8) Check your computer’s disk usage: Type “task manager” in the Windows search bar and select**Task Manager** , then in the Processes tab, look at the % at the top of the Disk column. If it’s no longer 100%, you’ve fixed the problem!

### Fix 6: Disable Antivirus Software temporarily

 If you’ve installed antivirus or anti-malware programs such as Norton, Kaspersky, AVG, Avast Behavior Shield or Malwarebytes, you should**temporarily turn them off or disable them** to see if they’re causing your disk usage problem.

 Please see your antivirus software’s documentation to learn how to disable it. You might also find these links useful:

* [**How to temporarily turn off Norton Antivirus program?**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
* [**How to stop AVG temporarily?**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
* [**How to disable Avast temporarily?**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

 Note that Microsoft has its own default anti-malware,**Windows Defender** . It’s automatically enabled even if you also have other antivirus applications installed. Even if you disable your other antivirus programs, Windows Defender is always there for you during that certain time range. So, no need to worry too much about temporarily turning antivirus off.

**Once you’ve disabled your antivirus** , check your computer’s disk usage again: Type “task manager” in the Windows search bar and select**Task Manager** , then in the Processes tab, look at the % at the top of the Disk column. If it’s no longer 100%, you’ve found the problem, and you should contact the vendor of your antivirus software to see if they can provide some help.

### Fix 7: Fix your StorAHCI.sys driver

**Note** : A million thanks to our warm-hearted reader Javier for the following solution.

 The Windows 10 100% disk usage problem might also be caused by some Advanced Host Controller Interface PCI-Express (AHCI PCIe) models running with the inbox**StorAHCI.sys** driver due to a firmware bug.

Here’s how to determine if this is your problem and fix it:

 1) Open **Device Manager** by pressing**Windows logo key** and**X** at the same time to choose**Device Manager** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/img_594b453d7e242.png)

 2) Expand the **IDE ATA/ATAPI Controllers**  category, and double-click the**AHCI controller** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/img_594b45719881f.png)

 3) Go to the **Driver** tab and click**Driver Details** . If you can see**storahci.sys** stored in a path of system32 folder, then you are running the inbox AHCI driver.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/img_594b4611132d9.png)

 4) Close the Driver Details window and go to**Details** tab. From the drop-down menu, select **Device Instance Path** . Make note of the path, starting from**VEN\_** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/img_594b474d5583c.png)

 5) Type**regedit** in the search box of**Start** panel, then hit**Enter** on your keyboard to run Registry Editor. Then go to:

**HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE \\ System \\ CurrentControlSet \\ Enum \\ PCI \\ < AHCI Controller \> \\ < Random Number \> \\ Device Parameters \\ Interrupt Management \\** **MessageSignaledInterruptProperties**

 The **< AHCI Controller \>**  here refers to the name you see from step 2).

 The **< Random Number \>** differs on different machines.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/img_594b48600f0e1.jpg)

 6) Double click the**MSISupported** key and change the value to**0** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/img_594b48d861882.jpg)

 7) Restart your computer after the change, then check your computer’s disk usage: Type “task manager” in the Windows search bar and select**Task Manager** , then in the Processes tab, look at the % at the top of the Disk column. If it’s no longer 100%, you’ve fixed the problem!

### Fix 8: Check the health of your disk

 You should also check if it’s a hardware problem, which could help you locate the culprit. You don’t need to be a professional to check for disk health, there’re solutions like HD Tune and CrystalDiskInfo in place that can help you find out the stats of your disk.

Here’s how you can check the disk health easily with HD Tune:

1. [**Download**](https://www.hdtune.com/download.html) and install the latest version of HD Tune.  
 (The trial version is enough for troubleshooting. You can get a license if you want to learn more about the disk’s performance.)  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/hd-tune-download.jpg)
2. Launch HD Tune. Select the**Health** tab.  
 Here you can see the S.M.A.R.T info of your disk. (S.M.A.R.T is a monitoring system providing a series of attributes or diagnostics for each disk model.) At this moment, you don’t need to figure out each entry’s meaning — simply check if there’s any one of them has a**Status** that is not “**Ok** “. If you see a warning, you may need to google the entry label and determine your next step.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/hd-tune-2.jpg)
3. On the top left corner, you can toggle the drop down menu to select the disk (if you have multiple). This will allow you to check the health of each disk.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/hd-tune-3.jpg)

 You’d also need to check if the disk has bad blocks. **Before you start, note that this process could take hours to complete.** You may want to try other fixes before this one.

1. In HD Tune, select the**Error Scan** tab. First make sure the**Quick Scan** checkbox is unchecked. Then click**Start** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/hd-tune-4.jpg)
2. Once it completes, check the graph and look for yellow or red blocks. If there’re any red (damaged) blocks, you should consider backing up your data and replace the faulty disk.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/hd-tune-6.jpg)
3. Again, you can use the drop down menu on the top left corner to scan different disk. It’s recommended you scan all the disk to make sure all your hard drives are in good condiction.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/hd-tune-3.jpg)

**Tips to secure your data** : Since hard drives have a finite lifetime and can fail without a warning, consider using a free backup software like AOMEI Backupper to [create a system image](https://prf.hn/click/camref:1011l3x6jb/pubref:drivereasyen2039/ar:drivereasyen2039/[p%5Fid:1100l557026]/destination:https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ubackup.com%2Ffeatures%2Fcreate-system-image.html) , especially when the disk carries important data. A backup system protects you against random disk failures.

### Fix 9: Switch to ChromeOS

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ChromeOSDesktop.jpg)

 Windows is a very old technology. Sure, Windows 10 is relatively new, but it’s still just the latest iteration of a decades-old operating system, designed for a bygone era (pre-internet).

 Now that we have the internet, fast connection speeds, free cloud storage, and endless web apps (like Gmail, Google Docs, Slack, Facebook, Dropbox and Spotify), the entire Windows way of doing things – with locally installed programs and local file storage – is totally outdated.

 Why is that a problem? Because when you’re constantly installing uncontrolled third-party programs, you’re constantly opening the door to viruses and other malware. (And Windows’ insecure permission system compounds this problem.)

 Plus the way Windows manages installed software and hardware has always been a problem. If your computer shuts down unexpectedly, or a program installs, uninstalls or updates incorrectly, you can get ‘registry’ corruptions. That’s why Windows PCs always slow down and become unstable over time.

 Also because everything’s installed and saved locally, it doesn’t take long before you run out of disk space, and your disk gets fragmented, which makes everything even slower and more unstable.

 For most people, the simplest way to solve Windows problems is to ditch Windows altogether, and **switch to a faster, more reliable, more secure, easier to use and cheaper operating system…**

[Google ChromeOS.](https://www.google.com/chromebook/chrome-os/)

 ChromeOS feels much like Windows, but instead of installing heaps of programs to email, chat, browse the internet, write documents, do school presentations, create spreadsheets, and whatever else you normally do on a computer, you use web apps. You don’t need to install anything at all.

 That means you don’t have virus and malware problems, and your computer doesn’t slow down over time, or become unstable.

And that’s just the start of the benefits…
