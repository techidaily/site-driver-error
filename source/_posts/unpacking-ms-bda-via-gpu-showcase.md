### Fix 1: Run Windows Updates

 One of the reasons for this is that Windows has yet to provide you with the proper driver update after your operating system upgrade. So you may need to run the update on your own.

Here is how to run Windows Updates:

 1) On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**I** at the same time, then click **Update & security** .

 2) Click**Check for updates** .

### Fix 3: Replace the graphics card

 If updating your graphics card driver doesn’t help to solve the problem, you may need to consider getting your graphics card replaced, as it might be faulty.

 Note that certain series of display card products are not certified to support Windows Display Driver Model 1.2 or higher, and therefore, do not have driver support for Windows 10\.

 Therefore, it is suggested that you change your current display driver to a more advanced one. You may need to consult professional advice on how to select a good graphics card for your computer.

### Fix 4: Downgrade operating system

 If you are not ready to make a new investment by purchasing a brand new graphics card for your PC, here is your alternative: downgrade your Windows 10 to its previous version, be it Windows 8 or Windows 7\.

 For more information as to how to downgrade your current operating system to its previous one, please refer to this post here: **[How to downgrade your Windows 10 to Windows 7/ 8.1?](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
