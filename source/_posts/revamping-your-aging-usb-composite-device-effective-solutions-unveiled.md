### Fix 1: Update your USB Composite Device driver

 The most likely cause for your USB Composite Device error is a device driver problem.

Fortunately, this is one of the easiest problems to fix.

 There are two ways to update your USB Composite Device driver:**manually** and**automatically** .

**Update your USB Composite Device driver manually** — You can update your driver manually by going to the hardware manufacturer’s website, and searching for the latest driver for your USB Composite Device. If you take this approach, be sure to choose the driver that’s compatible with the exact model number of your hardware, and your version of Windows.

**Update your USB Composite Device driver automatically** — If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

### Fix 2: Reinstall your USB controller drivers

1. On your keyboard, press the   **Windows logo ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/img_5b62735e40ac6.png)**  
**key**  
 and  
**R**  
  key simultaneously to open the Run box.
2. Type **devmgmt.msc** and press**Enter** .

4. Right-click on the first USB device and select**Uninstall device**  to remove it.  

**Important:** Make sure you’ve saved any open files on your computer before you click**Uninstall device** , as you might need to force shutdown and restart later.

5. Repeat step 4) with every other USB device that is listed under the**Universal Serial Bus controllers** entry.  

**Note:** Some USB devices have to do with your wired mouse, keyboard etc, which means uninstalling those devices will make them not working, don’t worry, just temporarily. As long as Windows restarts, it will automatically install the drivers again.
6. Once you’ve uninstalled them all,**restart** your computer.  

 If your mouse or keyboard is not working for now, you may need to force shutdown: you can press the power button of your computer for a few seconds until it begins to shutdown. Then, press the power button again to start your computer.
7. When you’ve logged on to your Windows desktop, plug your USB composite device into your computer and test.
