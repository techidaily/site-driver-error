### Fix 4: Disable antivirus programs temporarily

 The Nvidia drivers crash problem may also happen because of conflicts between your antivirus programs and Nvidia. You can test if this is the case by temporarily disable the antivirus programs to see if the crash reoccurs.

### Fix 5:**Update DirectX**

 DirectX is a suite of components in Windows that allows heavy multimedia apps such as games to interact with your video and audio cards.

### Fix 7: Check for hardware issues

 If the fixes above didn’t work, then the problem probably lies with the hardware. It can be an overheating, dust problem of your graphics card, or the components not being connected properly etc. So you should remove your graphics card from the computer case to do proper troubleshooting. Please make sure that you do this only when you know what you’re doing, since any mishandling with the hardware could possibly render your graphics card or your computer useless.
