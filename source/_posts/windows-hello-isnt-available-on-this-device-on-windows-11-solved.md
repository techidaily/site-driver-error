## Windows Hello Isn't Available on This Device on Windows 11 [Solved]

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/img_58b4da0963d89.jpg)

 If you’re having “**Windows Hello isn’t available on this device.** ” in your **Settings** windows, you’re not alone. Many Windows 10 users are reporting this problem as well. No worries, it’s possible to fix. Here is the 3-step fixes for you to fix your problem.

### **What is Windows Hello?**

**Windows Hello** allows you to login into your system by recognizing your fingerprint or your face or your iris (like Surface) rather than using a pin code or a password, provided that you have a webcam and a finger scanner that work.  
  
 With Windows 10 Anniversary Update, this feature has extended to apps and websites, which include banking apps and other sensitive apps.

### **How do I fix it?**

 Here are 3 solutions for you to try. You may not have to try them all; just work your way down until you find the one works for you.
  
[**1. Update Your PC**](https://silver-cuisine.pxf.io/nlgolx) [**2\. Enable Biometric from Administration**](#2)
