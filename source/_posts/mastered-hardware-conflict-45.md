## Fix 2: Manually uninstall and reinstall your device driver

 When the error message says your hardware device is not connected to the computer, chances are your device driver is missing or corrupted. In this case, manually uninstalling and reinstalling your device driver may help you out.

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo + R keys** simultaneously to open the Run box. Then enter**devmgmt.msc** and hit Enter.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/win11-how-to-open-the-Device-Manager.jpg)
2. In the**Device Manager** window, locate the device that’s giving you Code 45.
3. Right-click on that device entry and select**Uninstall device** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image-2.png)
4. Tick the checkbox for**Delete the driver software for this device** and click**Uninstall** (if you’re prompted for confirmation).

## Fix 3: Run the Windows Hardware and Devices Troubleshooter

 Microsoft offers you a**Hardware and Devices Troubleshooter** to diagnose and fix hardware issues. So try this built-in tool if any hardware problems happen to your device. To use it:

1. On your keyboard, hit the**Windows** key and type**power** . When**Windows PowerShell** shows up and is highlighted from the list, click**Run as Administrator** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/poweshell.png)
2. Copy and paste**_msdt.exe -id DeviceDiagnostic_** in the Powershell, then hit**Enter** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image-12.png)
3. Now you should see the Hardware and Devices Troubleshooter. Click**Next** to continue.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image-13.png)
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to finish troubleshooting.
5. Restart your computer and your problem should be resolved.

---

## Fix 4: Run System File Checker

 System File Checker (SFC) is a built-in Windows tool that scans and repairs corrupted system files. If you encounter the Code 45 issue in Device Manager, it’s likely that the file responsible for your device is missing or corrupted. So you should run SFC to fix the problem. To do so:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** . Then enter**cmd** .
2. Right-click **Command Prompt** to select **Run as administrator** , and then click **Yes** if prompted for permission.  
![how to open Command Prompt as an admin](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/win11-Command-Prompt-Run-as-administrator.jpg)
3. Once you see the command prompt, type **`sfc /scannow`**  and press **Enter** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image-15.png)
4. Windows will now verify the system files and automatically fix any detected issues.
5. Once the verification is complete, exit the Command Prompt.
6. Reconnect your hardware device and see if it’s working properly.

---

## Fix 5: Run CHKDSK

 CHKDSK (Check Disk) is a command run utility used to check the file system and status of the system’s hard drives. Sometimes the hard drive’s problem could be the possible reason for Code 45\. In that case, you can run chkdsk to fix your problem.

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** . Then enter**cmd** .
2. Right-click **Command Prompt** to select **Run as administrator** .  
![how to open Command Prompt as an admin](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/win11-Command-Prompt-Run-as-administrator.jpg)
3. The command prompt will once again display. Type in the command:`**chkdsk.exe /f /r**` and hit Enter.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image-16.png)
4. Type **Y** to confirm that you’d like to perform the disk check the next time you restart your computer. Please make sure you have closed all of your applications first.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image-17.png)

**Note** : Running a disk check could take some time to complete. So if you don’t have the time to run the disk check the next time you boot, you can skip it and reschedule again by following the steps above.

 Once the disk check has been completed, open Device Manager and see if Code 45 has been fixed.

 If this method doesn’t resolve your issue, don’t worry. There is something else to try.

---

## Fix 6: Run a DISM scan

**DISM** stands for **Deployment Image Servicing and Management** . Running a DISM scan can help fix computer errors. Here’s how to run a DISM scan:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** . Then enter**cmd** .
2. Right-click **Command Prompt** to select **Run as administrator** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![how to open Command Prompt as an admin](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/win11-Command-Prompt-Run-as-administrator.jpg)
3. Click **Yes** if prompted for permission.
4. The command prompt will once again display. Type in the command`**DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth**` and press**Enter** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image-18.png)
5. Wait for the scan to finish (it may take up to 20 minutes).
6. Restart your computer and relaunch Device Manager. Check to see if Code 45 has been fixed; if it has, then congrats! Otherwise, please move on to the next fix.

## Fix 7: Update your device drivers

**Manually update the driver** : you can go to the manufacturer’s website, find the latest driver that is compatible with your variant of the Windows system, and then install it on your computer. This requires time and computer skills.

**Automatically update the driver** : if you don’t have time or patience, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the [**7 days free trial**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) or the [**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) of Driver Easy.
