### Fix 2 – Clean install of the driver

Before getting started, make sure you stop all the NVIDIA-related programs or files. Here’s how:

#### End NVIDIA processes

1. Right-click any empty space on your taskbar and click**Task Manager** .

 _C:\\Windows\\System32\\DriverStore\\FileRepository\\nvoclock document_

 After you finish installing, reboot the machine for the changes to take effect and test if your NVIDIA driver is back on track. If not, move on to the third fix.

### Fix 3 – Temporarily disable antivirus

 The program you’re running in the background, whether it’s a GPU monitoring utility or antivirus software, might conflict with your NVIDIA driver installer and prevent it from launching. To see if that’s the case, you can**temporarily disable those background programs** and install the NVIDIA driver again. If the installation goes smoothly, then congrats! If the issue persists, don’t frustrate. There is one more fix to try.
