## 2: Update Device Drivers

 If reinstalling the network adapter driver fails to solve the problem for you, you should update your network card driver instead. If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

 1) [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy. 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

## 3: Update Software and Operating System

 Sometimes missing software updates and service packs could cause the Code 10 error in device manager. If you suspect this is the problem, it is suggested that you update and install the latest updates for Windows.

## 4: Manually fix corrupted registry entries

 One of the causes of the code 10 error could be corrupted registry entries. To fix the problem, you might want to fix the registry entries by yourself. **Note** : To use this method, you must be logged on to Windows as an **administrator** . **IMPORTANT** : Follow the steps in this section carefully. Serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly.

 1) On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** and **R** at the same time to invoke a **Run** command. Then type **regedit** in the search box and press **Enter** .

## Hardware Compatibility Issues
