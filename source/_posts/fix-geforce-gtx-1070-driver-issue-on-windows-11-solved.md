## Solution 1: Update your GTX 1070 driver

 This problem is probably caused the old or incorrect GTX 1070 driver you’re trying to install. Updating the driver can resolve the problem.

To update it:

 You can choose to download the latest GTX 1070 driver from official [NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) website manually or, if you’re not confident playing around with drivers, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**   and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now**   button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3) Click the **Update**  button next to a flagged NVIDIA driver to automatically download and install the correct version of this driver (you can do this with the FREE version).

Or click **Update All**  to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_  the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the Pro version – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).

4) Reboot your Windows 10 to see if the error message still pops up.

## Solution 2: Make sure the version of your Windows 10 not lower than 1511

 This problem could be also caused by the old version of your Windows 10\. The latest GeForce GTX 1070 driver requires a version from 1511 onwards of Windows 10.

To make sure you have the correct version of Windows 10:

1) On your keyboard, press the   **Windows logo key**  and **R**  at the same time to invoke the Run box.

 2)Type **winver** and press **Enter** .
