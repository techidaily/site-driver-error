 Bluetooth devices come really handy for everyone. With appropriate Bluetooth drivers installed, you have access to your wireless keyboard, your wireless mouse, your wireless headphones, your wireless speakers, and tons of other things on your laptops and desktops.

 In this post, we will show you some solutions that you may find helpful when you are having Bluetooth problems. Since there could be many different reasons why this problem occurs, and the causes differ greatly, there are different resolutions. You might need to try them one by one until you locate the right solution for you.

## Option 3: Update Bluetooth driver

 If, after trying the above, your Bluetooth still refuses to work, it’s time to update your device driver.

 You can do so via Device Manager or Windows Update, or you can also go to Lenovo’s support website to search for the driver by yourself. If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

 3) Click the **Update** button next to the flagged Bluetooth device to automatically download and install the correct version of its driver (you can do this with the FREE version). Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).
