## 1\. Remove unsafe or incompatible drivers

 This blue screen of death error is likely to be caused by unsafe or incompatible drivers.

 Microsoft once worked out a hotfix for Windows 7 or Windows Server 2008 R2 users. You can download it and have a try. But it’s not always helpful since the exact causes are different.

 Instead, you should verify if all the drivers installed in your PC is safe and secure. Uninstall drivers that you are not sure about the security or stability. Then restart your computer.

 Recently updated new drivers might be incompatible with your operating system.If you have installed such drivers, you should uninstall them as well.

See if this problem is resolved after the restart.
