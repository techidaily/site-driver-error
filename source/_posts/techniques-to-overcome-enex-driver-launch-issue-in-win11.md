## 1\. Turn off the memory Integrity setting

 ene.sys is a system file related to EneTechIo or EneIo, developed by ENE Technology, usually installed with driver software for ENE Technology’s hardware products. If you don’t have a hardware device from ENE specifically but still have the error message about ene.sys, then please check to see if there’s a program controlling the RGB lighting on your keyboard and/or mouse.

 If you don’t recall such an RGB lighting control software either, you can try to turn off Momory Integrity for this error message to disappear. To do so:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows** key and type**core isolation** , then select**Core Isolation** from the list.

2. Toggle off the option for Memory integrity.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-37.png)
3. Restart your computer for the change to take effect.

 Then see if the_**ene.sys driver cannot load error**_ still remains. If the error message is still seen, please repeat the above to toggle on the option for Memory Integrity, then move on to the next step.

 Turning off Memory Integrity may render the RGB lighting function on your keyboard and/or mouse not working anymore. It’s entirely up to you whether this is acceptable or not.

## 2\. Rename the ene.sys file

 As mentioned, ene.sys is a file that comes with a third-party hardware device. From what we know, it’s not a malicious file or driver: Windows Defender can be a bit sensitive about this issue. So to fix the ene.sys driver cannot load error, you can try to rename this file, so Windows Defender will skip it when running another scan. To rename ene.sys:

1. Boot your computer into Safe Mode as instructed here first:[**How to start Windows 10 in Safe Mode – 4 different methods**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) (the screenshots are from Windows 10, but the instructions work on Windows 11 as well).
2. On your keyboard, press the**Windows** key and the**E** key at the same time to open**File Explorer** .
3. Then go to**`C:\Windows\System32\drivers`** , and find the**ene.sys** file there.
4. Rename the ene.sys file to something like**eneold.sys** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-38.png)
5. When asked for permission, click**Continue** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-39.png)
6. When this is done, restart your computer into normal mode as instructed in the post shared in step 1, then see if the ene.sys driver cannot load error is fixed.

 If the_**ene.sys driver cannot load error**_ remains, please move on.
